I enjoyed reading this more than I thought I would. The emperor spent a great deal thinking about what it means to be human, philosophy, on life, on dying, and how best to navigate the world. Both the internal world of the mind and soul, and the external world of matter and other people. 

This book makes me want to keep a better journaling habit. And study philosophy. And not worry about things that do not matter. Because we all become dust in the end anyway. 

the great emperor also cut through what does matter. Such as service to others. Speaking truthfully. Not letting your situation bother you. 

Marcus reflects on the good qualities that he notices in other people. 
"Self control and resistance to distractions"
"Optimism in adversity - especially illness"

He also practiced gratitude in his journaling.
