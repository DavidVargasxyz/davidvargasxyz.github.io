## Shell Scripts 

- A group of Linux commands along with control structures and optional comments stored in a text file. 
- Can be executed directly at the Linux command prompt. 
- Do not need to be compiled as they are interpreted by the shell line by line.
- managing packages and users, administering partitions and file systems, monitoring file system utilization, trimming log files, archiving and compressing files, finding and removing unnecessary files, starting and stopping database services and applications, and producing reports. 
- Run by the shell one at a time in the order in which they are listed. 
- Each line is executed as if it is typed and run at the command prompt. 
- Control structures are utilized for creating and managing conditional and looping constructs. 
- Comments are also generally included to add information about the script such as the author name, creation date, previous modification dates, purpose, and usage. 
- If the script encounters an error during execution, the error message is printed on the screen.

- Can use the nl command to enumerate the lines for troubleshooting.
- Can store your scripts in the */usr/local/bin* directory, which is included in the PATH of all users by default.

### Script01: Displaying System Information

- Create the first script called *sys_info.sh* in */usr/local/bin/*   
- Use the vim editor with sudo to write the script. 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Display Basic System Information"
echo "=================================="
echo
echo "The hostname, hardware, and OS information is:"
/usr/bin/hostnamectl
echo
echo "The Following users are currently logged in:"
/usr/bin/who
```

- Within vim, press the ESC key and then type :set nu to view line numbers associated with each line entry.
- Must add execute bit to run the script



### Executing a Script 

```bash
[chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sys_info.sh](<[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sys_info.sh
[root@server30 ~]# ll /usr/local/bin/sys_info.sh
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 244 Jul 30 09:47 /usr/local/bin/sys_info.sh>)
```

- Any user on the system can now run this script using either its name or the full path.

Let's run the script and see what the output will look like:
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# /usr/local/bin/sys_info.sh
Display Basic System Information
==================================

The hostname, hardware, and OS information is:
 Static hostname: server30
       Icon name: computer-vm

```

### Debugging a Script 

Can either append the `-x` option to the "`#!/bin/bash`" at the beginning of the script to look like "`#!/bin/bash -x`", or execute the script as follows:
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# bash -x sys_info.sh
+ echo 'Display Basic System Information'
Display Basic System Information
+ echo ==================================
==================================
+ echo

+ echo 'The hostname, hardware, and OS information is:'
The hostname, hardware, and OS information is:
+ /usr/bin/hostnamectl
 Static hostname: server30
       Icon name: computer-vm
         Chassis: vm ðŸ–´
      Machine ID: eaa6174e108d4a27bd6197548ce77270
         Boot ID: 13d8b3c167b24757b3678e4fd3fe19ee
  Virtualization: oracle
Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.3 (Plow)     
     CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9::baseos
          Kernel: Linux 5.14.0-362.24.1.el9_3.x86_64
    Architecture: x86-64
 Hardware Vendor: innotek GmbH
  Hardware Model: VirtualBox
Firmware Version: VirtualBox
+ echo

+ echo 'The Following users are currently logged in:'
The Following users are currently logged in:
+ /usr/bin/who
root     pts/0        2024-07-30 07:22 (172.16.7.95)
```


- Actual lines from the script prefixed by the + sign and followed by the command execution result. 
- Shows the line number of the problem line in the output if there is any. 
- This way you can identify any issues pertaining to the path, command name, use of special characters, etc., and address it quickly.

Change one of the echo commands in the script to "iecho" and re-run the script in the debug mode to see the error:
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# bash -x sys_info.sh
+ echo 'Display Basic System Information'
Display Basic System Information
+ echo ==================================
==================================
+ iecho
/usr/local/bin/sys_info.sh: line 4: iecho: command not found
+ echo 'The hostname, hardware, and OS information is:'
The hostname, hardware, and OS information is:
+ /usr/bin/hostnamectl
 Static hostname: server30
       Icon name: computer-vm
         Chassis: vm ðŸ–´
      Machine ID: eaa6174e108d4a27bd6197548ce77270
         Boot ID: 13d8b3c167b24757b3678e4fd3fe19ee
  Virtualization: oracle
Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.3 (Plow)     
     CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9::baseos
          Kernel: Linux 5.14.0-362.24.1.el9_3.x86_64

+ /usr/bin/who
root     pts/0        2024-07-30 07:22 (172.16.7.95)
```

### Script02: Using Local Variables

- Create a script called *use_var.sh* will 
- Define a local variable and display its value on the screen. 
- Re-check the value of the variable after the script execution has completed. 
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# vim /usr/local/bin/use_var.sh

#!/bin/bash

echo "Setting a Local Variable"
echo "========================"
SYSNAME=server30.example.com
echo "The hostname of this system is $SYSNAME"
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/use_var.sh

[root@server30 ~]# use_var.sh
Setting a Local Variable
========================
The hostname of this system is server30.example.com
```

If you run the echo command to see what is stored in the SYSNAME
variable, you will get nothing:
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# echo $SYSNAME

```

### Script03: Using Pre-Defined Environment Variables 

The following script called pre_env.sh will display the values of SHELL and LOGNAME environment variables:
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# vim /usr/local/bin/pre_env.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "The location of my shell command is:"
echo $SHELL
echo "I am logged in as $LOGNAME"
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pre_env.sh

[root@server30 ~]# pre_env.sh
The location of my shell command is:
/bin/bash
I am logged in as root
```

### Script04: Using Command Substitution

- Can use the command substitution feature of the bash shell and store the output generated by the command
into a variable. 

- Two different ways to use command substitution: Backtics or subshell

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SYSNAME=$(hostname)
KERNVER=`uname -r`
echo "The hostname is $SYSNAME"
echo "The kernel version is $KERNVER"
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# vim /usr/local/bin/cmd_out.sh

[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cmd_out.sh

[root@server30 ~]# cmd_out.sh
The hostname is server30
The kernel version is 5.14.0-362.24.1.el9_3.x86_64
```

# Shell Parameters 

- An entity that holds a value such as a name, special character, or number. 
- The parameter that holds a **name** is referred to as a **variable**
- a **special character** is referred to as a **special parameter**
	- represents the command or script itself (\$0), count of supplied arguments (\$\* or \$@), all arguments (\$#), and PID of the process (\$\$)
- one or more digits, except for 0 is referred to as a **positional parameter** (a command line argument). 
	- (\$1, \$2, \$3 . . .) is an argument supplied to a script at the time of its invocation
	- position is determined by the shell based on its location with respect to the calling script.
	- Positional parameters beyond 9 are to be enclosed in curly brackets. 


![](/images/image-G1VF6C4I.jpg)

- Just like the variable and command substitutions, the shell uses the dollar (\$) sign for special and positional parameter expansions as well.

### Script05: Using Special and Positional Parameters

Create *com_line_arg.sh* to show the supplied arguments, total count, value of the first argument, and PID of the script:
```bash
[root@server30 ~]# vim /usr/local/bin/com_line_arg.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "There are $# arguments specified at the command line"
echo "The arguments supplied are: $*"
echo "The first argument is: $1"
echo "The Process ID of the script is: $$"                                          
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/com_line_arg.sh

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg.sh
There are 0 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: 
The first argument is: 
The Process ID of the script is: 1935

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg.sh the dog jumped over the frog
There are 6 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: the dog jumped over the frog
The first argument is: the
The Process ID of the script is: 1936
```


### Script06: Shifting Command Line Arguments

`shift` command
- Used to move arguments one position to the left. 
- During this move, the value of the first argument is lost. 

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# vim /usr/local/bin/com_line_arg_shift.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "There are $# arguments specified at the command line"
echo "The arguments supplied are: $*"
echo "The first argument is: $1"
echo "The Process ID of the script is: $$"
shift
echo "The new first argument after the first shift is: $1"
shift
echo "The new first argument after the second shift is: $1"
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/com_line_arg_shift.sh

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg_shift.sh
There are 0 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: 
The first argument is: 
The Process ID of the script is: 1941
The new first argument after the first shift is: 
The new first argument after the second shift is: 

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg_shift.sh the dog jumped over the frog
There are 6 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: the dog jumped over the frog
The first argument is: the
The Process ID of the script is: 1942
The new first argument after the first shift is: dog
The new first argument after the second shift is: jumped
```

- Multiple shifts in a single attempt may be performed by furnishing a count of desired shifts to the shift command as an argument. For example, "shift 2" will carry out two shifts, "shift 3" will make three shifts, and so on.

# Shell Parameters 

- An entity that holds a value such as a name, special character, or number. 
- The parameter that holds a **name** is referred to as a **variable**
- a **special character** is referred to as a **special parameter**
	- represents the command or script itself (\$0), count of supplied arguments (\$\* or \$@), all arguments (\$#), and PID of the process (\$\$)
- one or more digits, except for 0 is referred to as a **positional parameter** (a command line argument). 
	- (\$1, \$2, \$3 . . .) is an argument supplied to a script at the time of its invocation
	- position is determined by the shell based on its location with respect to the calling script.
	- Positional parameters beyond 9 are to be enclosed in curly brackets.

echo "There are $# arguments specified at the command line"
echo "The arguments supplied are: $*"
echo "The first argument is: $1"
echo "The Process ID of the script is: $$"                                          
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/com_line_arg.sh

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg.sh
There are 0 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: 
The first argument is: 
The Process ID of the script is: 1935

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg.sh the dog jumped over the frog
There are 6 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: the dog jumped over the frog
The first argument is: the
The Process ID of the script is: 1936
```

echo "The Process ID of the script is: $$"
shift
echo "The new first argument after the first shift is: $1"
shift
echo "The new first argument after the second shift is: $1"
```

```bash
[root@server30 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/com_line_arg_shift.sh

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg_shift.sh
There are 0 arguments specified at the command line
The arguments supplied are: 
The first argument is: 
The Process ID of the script is: 1941
The new first argument after the first shift is: 
The new first argument after the second shift is: 

[root@server30 ~]# com_line_arg_shift.sh the dog jumped over the frog

The arguments supplied are: the dog jumped over the frog
The first argument is: the
The Process ID of the script is: 1942
The new first argument after the first shift is: dog
The new first argument after the second shift is: jumped
```

- Multiple shifts in a single attempt may be performed by furnishing a count of desired shifts to the shift command as an argument. For example, "shift 2" will carry out two shifts, "shift 3" will make three shifts, and so on.

## Shell Scripting Review Questions

## Shell Scripting DIY Labs

### Lab: Write Script to Create Logical Volumes 

- Present 2x1GB virtual disks to server40 in VirtualBox Manager. 
- As user1 with sudo on server40, write a single bash script to create 2x400MB partitions on each disk using parted and then bring both partitions into LVM control with the `pvcreate` command. 
```bash
 vim /usr/local/bin/lvscript.sh
```

- Create a volume group called `vgscript` and add both physical volumes to it. 
- Create three logical volumes each of size 200MB and name them lvscript1, lvscript2, and lvscript3.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for DEVICE in "/dev/sd"{b..c}
do
        echo "Creating partition 1 with the size of 400MB on $DEVICE"
        parted $DEVICE mklabel msdos
        parted $DEVICE mkpart primary 1 401
        pvcreate $DEVICE[1]

        echo "Creating partition 2 with the size of 400MB on $DEVICE"
        parted $DEVICE mkpart primary 402 802
        pvcreate $DEVICE[2]
        vgcreate vgscript $DEVICE[1] $DEVICE[2]
done
for LV in "lvscript"{1..3}
do
        echo "Creating logical volume $LV in volume group vgscript with the size of 200MB"
        lvcreate vgscript -L 200MB -n $LV
done
```

### Lab: Write Script to Create File Systems 

- Write another bash script to create xfs, ext4, and vfat file system structures in the logical volumes, respectively. 
- Create mount points /mnt/xfs, /mnt/ext4, and /mnt/vfat, and mount the file systems. 
- Include the df command with -h in the script to list the mounted file systems.
```bash
vim /usr/local/bin/fsscript.sh
```

```bash
[root@server40 ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fsscript.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for DEVICE in lvscript{1..3}
do
if [ "$DEVICE" = lvscript1 ]
then
        echo "Creating xfs filesystem on logical volume lvscript1"

### Lab 21-3: Write Script to Configure New Network Connection Profile 

- Present a new network interface to server40 in VirtualBox Manager. 
- As user1 with sudo on server40, write a single bash script to run the nmcli command to configure custom IP assignments (choose your own settings) on the new network device. 
- Make a copy of the /etc/hosts file as part of this script. 
- Choose a hostname of your choice and add a mapping to the /etc/hosts file without overwriting existing file content.
```bash
[root@server40 ~]# vim /usr/local/bin/network.sh
