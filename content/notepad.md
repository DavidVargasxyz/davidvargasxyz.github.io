That's a good question. For systemtlc, you can do a ```systemctl daemon-reload``` and see if that would've resolved that issue. Are you updating any packages along the way? Because I never have had to reboot to fix things. And for kvdo, another odd one. Not sure if the dnf cache was tripping or something but you can try ```sudo dnf clean all```

I guess also if it explicitly asked you to install or it stated the binary did not exist you can check with ```which vdo``` to make sure it's actually installed.  I would try to install reinstall mainly
Checking logs is another thing also. Using systemctl to check the status, that gives you some details and also don't forget ```journalctl``` that holds a lot of information for you

If time is getting out of sync constantly you’ll need to dig in as to why it’s not syncing since restarting the service isn’t working. Rebooting wont be the available solution in prod and likely is a temporary fix 

Check out the logs and man pages for chrony / chronyd 

Check if it can talk to the ntp server 

Just a few things to look into

## Grow online audience

Niche = Who is the target and what is the value?

How to generate ideas:
What are all the different content buckets of ideas?

What's popular on blogs that are targeting that audience?

What are other YouTube channels in the space?


Copy things that work

Be a guide not a guru.

The 10% edge: Who is the audience that you are 10% ahead of that you can illuminate the path for?

Spend a good amount of time on title and thumbnail
