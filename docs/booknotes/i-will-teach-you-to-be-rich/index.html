## 10 Rules for a Rich Life
<div markdown="1">
1\. A Rich Life means you can spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.
<p>2. Focus on the Big Wins—the five to ten things that get you disproportionate results, including automating your savings and investing, finding a job you love, and negotiating your salary. Get the Big Wins right and you can order as many lattes as you want.</p>
<p>3. Investing should be very boring—and very profitable—over the long term. I get more excited eating tacos than checking my investment returns.</p>
<p>4. There’s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn. I have readers who earn $50,000/year and ones who earn $750,000/year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling spending is important, but your earnings become super-linear.</p>
<p>5. Your friends and family will have lots of “tips” once you begin your financial journey. Listen politely, then stick to the program.</p>
<p>6. Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“I need to cut back on eating out . . .”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll <em>always</em> spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book, just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it. Applying even one new idea from a book is worth it. (Like this one.)</p>
<p>7. Beware of the endless search for “advanced” tips. So many people seek out high-level answers to avoid the real, hard work of improving step by step. It’s easier to dream about winning the Boston Marathon than to go out for a ten-minute jog every morning. Sometimes the most advanced thing you can do is the basics, consistently.</p>
<p>8. You’re in control. This isn’t a Disney movie and nobody’s coming to rescue you. Fortunately, you can take control of your finances and build your Rich Life.</p>
<p>9. Part of creating your Rich Life is the willingness to be unapologetically different. Once money isn’t a primary constraint, you’ll have the freedom to design your own Rich Life, which will almost certainly be different from the average person’s. Embrace it. This is the fun part!</p>
<p>10. Live life outside the spreadsheet. Once you automate your money using the system in this book, you’ll see that the most important part of a Rich Life is outside the spreadsheet—it involves relationships, new experiences, and giving back. You earned it.</p>
<p>Credit cards give you thousands of dollars worth of perks. If you pay your bill on time, they’re a free short-term loan. They can help you keep track of your spending much more easily than cash, and they let you download your transaction history for free. Most offer free warranty extensions on your purchases and free rental car insurance.</p>
<p>Many offer rewards and points worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>As long as you manage them well, they’re worth having.</p>
<p>Our largest purchases are almost always made on credit, and people with good credit save tens of thousands of dollars on these purchases.</p>
<p>Two main components to your credit (also known as your credit history): your credit report and your credit score.</p>
<p><strong>credit report</strong> gives potential lenders basic information about you, your accounts, and your payment history. It tracks all credit-related activities (e.g., credit cards and loans), although recent activities
are given higher weight.</p>
<p><strong>credit score</strong> (often called your FICO score because it was created by the Fair Isaac Corporation</p>
<p>Single, easy-to-read number between 300 and 850 that represents your credit risk to lenders. It’s like an SAT score for the credit industry (higher is better). The lenders take this number and, with a few other pieces of information, such as your salary and age, decide if they’ll lend you money for credit like a credit card, mortgage, or car loan.</p>
<p>They’ll charge you more or less for the loan depending on your score, which signifies how risky you are.</p>
<p>Check your credit score and credit report—and you should do it right now. Once a year, by law, you’re allowed to obtain your credit report for free at annualcreditreport.com.</p>
<p>Lots of people use Credit Karma (creditkarma.com) to get a free credit score, but I prefer the official credit score from MyFico (myfico.com), which is more accurate even though it has a small fee.</p>
<p>If you have good credit, it makes you less risky to lenders, meaning they can offer you a better interest rate on loans.</p>
<p>Credit Score vs. Credit Report</p>
<p>What your credit score is based on:</p>
<p>What your credit report includes:</p>
<p>35% payment history (How reliable you are. Late payments hurt you.)</p>
<p>■  Basic identification information</p>
<p>30% amounts owed (How much you owe and how much credit you have available, aka your credit utilization rate)</p>
<p>■  A list of all your credit accounts 15% length of history (How long you’ve had credit)</p>
<p>■  Your credit history, or whom you’ve paid, how consistently, and any
late payments</p>
<p>10% new credit</p>
<p>(Older accounts are better, because they show you’re reliable.)</p>
<p>■  Amount of loans</p>
<p>10% types of credit</p>
<p>(For example, credit cards, student loans. Varied is better.)</p>
<p>■  Credit inquiries, or who else has requested your credit info (other
lenders)</p>
<p>Get your credit score at myfico.com for a small fee.</p>
<p>■  Get your free credit report once a year at annualcreditreport.com</p>
<p>How Credit Scores Affect What You Pay</p>
<p>Building Credit with Credit Cards</p>
<p>start with credit cards</p>
<p>fastest and most concrete way to optimize your credit.</p>
<p>Let’s say you buy this . . .</p>
<p>Paying minimum payments, it will take this long to pay it off . . .</p>
<p>You’ll pay this much in interest</p>
<p>$1,000 iPhone</p>
<p>9 years, 2 months</p>
<p>$732.76</p>
<p>$1,500 computer</p>
<p>13 years, 3 months</p>
<p>$1,432.19</p>
<p>$10,000 furniture</p>
<p>32 years, 2 months</p>
<p>$13,332.06</p>
<p>Try calculating how much your own purchases really cost at bankrate.com/brm/calc/minpayment.asp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t accept credit card offers that come in the mail or from retail stores like Gap or Nordstrom.</li>
<li>Squeeze every reward you can out of your credit cards.</li>
<li>Pick a good one, then move on with your life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="credit-card-rewards">Credit Card Rewards</h2>
<p>First, decide what you want to get rewarded with—cash back or travel. I recommend cash back because it’s straightforward, there are excellent cash back cards.</p>
<p>Once you decide on the primary reward you want, use a site like bankrate.com to sort through your options.</p>
<p>Most of the best rewards cards have fees. Are they worth it? You
should run the numbers to decide, which takes less than 5 minutes.
Here’s a quick rule of thumb: If you spend thousands per month on your
credit card, the rewards are usually worth it. But if you spend more
modestly or you’re not sure whether you want to pay a fee, spend a few
minutes doing a quick analysis by searching for “credit card rewards
calculator.” Plug in your numbers and you’ll quickly see which rewards
cards are worth it for you.</p>
<p>Don’t sign up for retail store credit cards.</p>
<p>high fees, near-extortionate interest rates, and terrible rewards?</p>
<p>Don’t go card crazy.</p>
<p>Two or three is a good rule of thumb</p>
<p><em>If you’re booking travel or eating out, use a travel card to maximize
rewards. For everything else, use a cash back card.</em></p>
<p>The card I use for travel and eating out is the Chase Sapphire
Reserve. For everything else, I use an Alliant cash back card. And for
business, I use a Capital One cash back business card. For extra
benefits, I have an Amex Platinum card.</p>
<p>1. Pay off your credit card regularly.</p>
<p>Try to get fees on your cards waived.</p>
<p>Negotiate a lower APR.</p>
<p>4. Keep your main cards for a long time, and keep them active—but also
keep them simple</p>
<p>What to Do If You Miss a Payment</p>
<p>. I understand I was late, but I’d like to have it waived.</p>
<p>Credit card rep: Why?</p>
<p>You: It was a mistake. It won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the
fee removed.</p>
<p>Get more credit. (Warning! Do this only if you have no debt.)</p>
<p>Use your credit card’s secret perks!</p>
<p> Automatic warranty doubling</p>
<p>Car rental insurance</p>
<p>Trip-cancellation insurance:</p>
<p> Concierge services:</p>
<p>Always Track Your Calls to Financial Companies</p>
<p>Think ahead before closing accounts. If you’re applying for a major
loan—for a car, home, or education—don’t close any accounts within six
months of filing the loan application.</p>
<p>to inspire you to take action on paying off your student debt, play
with the financial calculators at bankrate.com. You’ll be able to see
how paying different amounts changes the total amount you’ll owe.</p>
<p>Second, I want to encourage you to put at least $50 more each month
toward any debt you have.</p>
<p>Figure out how much debt you have.</p>
<p>. Decide what to pay off first.</p>
<p>Prioritizing Your Debt</p>
<p>Snowball method: lowest balance first</p>
<p>Standard method: highest APR first</p>
<p>How it works</p>
<p>Pay the minimum on all cards, but pay more on the card with the lowest
balance. Once you pay off the first card, repeat with the next-lowest
balance.</p>
<p>Pay the minimum on all cards, but pay more on the card with the
highest interest. Once you pay off the first card, repeat with the
next-highest-APR card.</p>
<p>Why it works</p>
<p>This is all about psychology and small wins. Once you pay off the
first card, you’re more motivated to pay off the next one.</p>
<p>Mathematically, you want to pay off the credit card that’s costing you
the most first.</p>
<p>. Negotiate down the APR.</p>
<p>: Hi. I’m going to be paying off my credit card debt more
aggressively beginning next week, and I’d like a lower APR.</p>
<p>Credit card rep: <em>Uh, why?</em></p>
<p>You: I’ve decided to be more aggressive about paying off my debt, and
that’s why I’d like a lower APR. Other cards are offering me rates at
half of what you’re offering. Can you lower my rate by 50 percent, or
only 40 percent?</p>
<p>Credit card rep: <em>Hmm . . . After reviewing your account, I’m afraid
we can’t offer you a lower APR. We can offer you a credit limit
increase, however.</em></p>
<p>You: No, that won’t work for me. Like I mentioned, other credit cards
are offering me zero percent introductory rates for twelve months, as
well as APRs of half what you’re offering. I’ve been a customer for X
years, and I’d prefer not to switch my balance over to a low-interest
card. Can you match the other credit card rates, or can you go lower?</p>
<p>Credit card rep: <em>I see . . . Hmm, let me pull something up here.
Fortunately, the system is suddenly letting me offer you a reduced
APR. That is effective immediately.</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t work every time, but when it does, you can save a
significant amount of money with a five-minute conversation. Make the
call, and if you’re successful, don’t forget to recalculate the
figures in your debt spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Decide where the money to pay off your credit cards will come from.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing spending and prioritizing debt.</strong> The most sustainable way
to pay off credit card debt is also the least sexy. Unlike balance
transfers or HELOC borrowing, it’s not very exciting to tell people
you decided to spend less on other things so you could pay off your
debt. But it works.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to these discussions:</p>
<p>■ “The Next $100” concept here.</p>
<p>■ Figuring out how much you can afford to put toward your debt using
the Conscious Spending Plan.</p>
<p>■ The “Save $1,000 in 30 Days” Challenge.</p>
<p>■ Setting up automatic payments.</p>
<p>■ My bonus resources at iwillteachyoutoberich.com/bonus</p>
<p>paying off debt just takes a plan and the patience to execute it</p>
<p>magine the relief you’ll feel when you see your debt growing smaller
and smaller with each passing month.</p>
<p>Being in debt means giving up choices, means staying at a job you hate
because it pays good money, means not being able to build a decent
savings account.</p>

Apply for more credit, if you’re debt-free. Make sure you’re getting
the most out of your cards.</p>
<p><strong>If you have debt, start paying it off (one week to plan, then start
paying more).</strong> Not tomorrow, not next week, today: Give yourself one
week to figure out how much you owe, call the lender to negotiate down
the APR or restructure your payments (in the case of student loans),
and set up your automatic payment with more money than you’re paying
now. Getting out of debt quickly will be the best financial decision
you ever make.</p>
<p>get your bank accounts set up right.</p>
<p>picking the right ones, optimizing them, and making sure you’re not
paying unnecessary fees</p>
<p>your bank’s fees can be more important than the interest rate it
offers:</p>
<p>Don’t worry about micro-optimizing your bank account interest rates.
Just pick great bank accounts and move on.</p>
<p>You might think I’d encourage you to have your checking account and
savings account at the same place. Surprisingly, I recommend two
different accounts at two <em>separate</em> banks. Here’s why: Having your
money in two separate accounts—and banks—uses psychology to keep your
savings growing.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the money available in your discretionary (checking)
account because you’ve spent your “going out” money, you’ll know it.
Having a separate savings account forces you to keep your long-term
goals in mind instead of just blowing them off to have a few rounds of
drinks. Finally, in my experience, banks that try to offer checking
and saving and investing tend to be mediocre at all of them.</p>
<p>not just about your immediate earnings—it’s about developing the right
habits.</p>
<p>the perfect time to start: when the stakes are low. Build the right
habits when the amounts are small—with the right accounts, with
automatic saving and investing—so that when your income increases,
your habits are rock-solid.</p>
<p>Most basic option (good for lazy people): A checking account and a
savings account at any local bank. This is the bare minimum. Even if
you already have these accounts, it’s worth talking to your bank to be
sure you’re not paying fees.</p>
<p>Basic option + small optimization (recommended for most people): This
option means opening accounts at two separate institutions: a no-fee
checking account at your local bank and a high-yield online savings
account.</p>
<p>Advanced setup + full optimization (perfect for people who read things
like Lifehacker and The 4-Hour Workweek):</p>
<p>This setup consists of maintaining several checking accounts and
savings accounts at different banks, usually to eke out the most
interest and services that various banks have to offer. For example, I
have an interest-bearing checking account at an online bank and a
savings account at a different online bank.</p>
<p>My Accounts. All of my money goes through my interest-bearing Schwab
online checking account. Deposits happen through direct deposit or by
taking a photo of a check and depositing it through the Schwab app.</p>
<p>My System. My finances work on a monthly cycle, and my system
automatically disburses money where it needs to go. I’ve set up
accounts to draw from my checking account. For example, my Capital One
360 savings account automatically withdraws a certain amount every
month from my checking account, as does my investment account (more
about these in Chapter 3). For rewards, tracking, and consumer
protection, I pay my bills using my credit card. The credit card is
automatically paid in full every month by my online checking account.
For cash expenses, I use the Schwab ATM card to withdraw money at any
ATM nationwide. All ATM charges are automatically reimbursed at the
end of the month. Generally, I use my Capital One 360 account as a
receiver, not a sender: I rarely transfer money out of there unless I
need to cover a temporary shortage in my checking account or want to
spend savings money on something important, like a vacation . . </p>
<p>I look for three things: trust, convenience, and features.</p>
<p>Trust.</p>
<p>don’t trust Big Banks anymore.</p>
<p>filthy double charges for using another bank’s ATM, then count on our
inaction to make money off us.</p>
<p>ask friends if they have a bank they love.</p>
<p>browse the major bank websites. Within about five minutes, you should
be able to tell which banks are trustworthy and which are not by
seeing how straightforward they are with their accounts and fees.</p>
<p>our bank shouldn’t nickel-and-dime you through minimums and fees. It
should have a website with clear descriptions of different services,
an easy setup process, and 24/7 customer service available by phone.
Another thing: Ask them if they send you promotional material every
damn week. I don’t want more junk mail! I don’t need more cross-sells!</p>
<p>Convenience.</p>
<p>needs to be easy to put money in, get money out, and transfer money
around. This means its website has to work, and you need to be able to
get help when you need it—whether by email or by phone.</p>
<p>Features.</p>
<p>The bank’s interest rate should be competitive. Transferring money
around should be easy and free, because you’ll be doing a lot of it,
and you should have free bill paying. Their app or website should be
something you enjoy using.</p>
<p>Schwab Bank Investor Checking with Schwab One Brokerage Account
(schwab.com/banking): This is the checking account I use</p>
<p>no fees, no minimums, no-fee overdraft protection, free bill pay, free
checks, an ATM card, automatic transfers, and—best of all—unlimited
reimbursement of any ATM usage. That means you can withdraw from any
ATM and you’ll pay no fees. When I saw this account, I wanted to marry
it.</p>
<p>you need to open a Schwab brokerage (investment) account to get all
fees waived, you don’t actually need to use the investment account. It
can just sit there, empty, as you use the magnificent features in the
checking account. You can deposit money by transfer, direct deposit, or mobile check
deposit.</p>
<p>You cannot deposit physical cash through this account, so if
depositing cash is important, you’ll need to pair this checking
account with another checking account.</p>
<p>Your local bank checking account with no fees and no minimums.</p>
<p>Online savings accounts let you earn more interest with lower hassle.
And because you’ll be primarily sending money there, not withdrawing
it, what does it matter if it takes three days to get your money?</p>
<p>Capital One 360 Savings</p>
<p>This is the savings account I use. It lets you create virtual
sub-savings accounts, in which you can specify savings goals like an
emergency fund, wedding, or down payment for a house. You can also set
up automatic transfers to other accounts (“Transfer $100 on the 1st of
every month from my checking account to my savings account, and send
$20 to my investment account on the 5th of every month”). There are no
fees, no minimums, and no tricky up-sells or annoying promotions. It’s
not always the highest interest rate, but it’s close. Capital One 360
Savings is just a simple savings account that works.</p>
<p>Ally Online Savings Account (ally.com/bank): Also recommended. This
no-fee savings account also lets you create multiple savings accounts,
which will help your automation system. It has solid interest rates
and works great.</p>

<p>keep your old account open with a small amount of money in it in case

your old account. Set a 60-day calendar reminder to close the old
account. And we’re off to our next step!</p>
<p>you need to optimize your checking and savings accounts. This means
you shouldn’t be paying fees or minimums. The key to optimizing an
account is talking to an actual customer service rep, either in person
or on the phone.</p>
<p>Almost All Bank Fees Are Negotiable</p>
<p><strong>Open a checking account or assess the one you already have (one
hour).</strong></p>
<p>Open an online high-interest savings account (three hours).</p>
<p><strong>Optional: Open an online checking account (two hours).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fund your online savings account (one hour).</strong> Leave one and a half
months of living expenses in your checking account, or as close to it
as you can manage. (The little extra prevents overdrafts as you’re
getting used to transferring money between accounts. Remember, most
transfers take a day or two.) Transfer the rest to your savings
account—even if it’s only $30.</p>
<p>ix systematic steps you should take to invest.</p>
<p>Rung 1: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, invest to take full
advantage of it and contribute just enough to get 100 percent of the
match. A “401(k) match” means that for every dollar you contribute to
your 401(k), your company will “match” your contribution up to a
certain amoun</p>
<p>Rung 2: Pay off your credit card and any other debt.</p>
<p>Rung 3: Open up a Roth IRA (see The Beauty of Roth IRAs) and
contribute as much money as possible to it. (As long as your income is
$120,000 or less, you’re allowed to contribute up to $5,500 in 2018.
For current contribution limits, search for “Roth IRA contribution
limits.”</p>
<p>Rung 4: If you have money left over, go back to your 401(k) and
contribute as much as possible to it</p>
<p>Rung 5: HSA: If you have access to a Health Savings Account (HSA), it
can also double as an investment account with incredible tax features
that few people know about</p>
<p>Rung 6: If you still have money left to invest, open a regular
non-retirement (“taxable”) investment account and put as much as
possible there. For more about this, see Chapter 7. Also, pay extra on
any mortgage debt you have, and consider investing in yourself:
Whether it’s starting a company or getting an additional degree,
there’s often no better investment than your own career.</p>
<p>401(k)</p>
<p>It’s a “retirement” account because it gives you large tax advantages
if you agree not to withdraw your money from the account until you
reach the retirement age of 59½.</p>
<p>401(k) Benefit #1: Using Pretax Money Means an Instant 25 Percent
Accelerator</p>
<p>isn’t taxed until you withdraw it many years later</p>
<p>a regular investment account</p>
<p>you don’t get many tax advantages</p>
<p>that extra 25 percent turns out to make a huge difference as it gets
compounded more and more.</p>
<p>401(k) Benefit #2: Your Employer Match Means Free Money</p>
<p>say your company offers a 1:1 (“one-to-one”) match up to 5 percent.
This means your company will match every dollar you invest up to 5
percent of your salary</p>
<p>401(k) Benefit #3: Automatic Investing.</p>
<p>What if I switch jobs?</p>
<p><strong>1. Move it to an IRA.</strong></p>
<p>This option is preferred. It lets you “roll over” your 401(k) money
into an IRA, which is great, because an IRA gives you more control
over where you invest your money, including lifecycle funds and index
funds, which we’ll cover in Chapter 7. Call your discount brokerage,
such as Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab (you’ll be signed up with one of
these by the end of the chapter), and ask for their help with a 401(k)
rollover, including converting to a Roth IRA.</p>
<p>2. Roll your money from the old company’s 401(k) to the new company’s
401(k).</p>
<p>investing choices are limited. Plus, the main reason to contribute to
a 401(k) is to take advantage of your employer’s match, which won’t
apply to funds you roll into the new account.</p>
<p><strong>3. Leave it at your current company.</strong> This is almost always a bad
move, because you’ll forget about it and certainly won’t stay up to
date on the investment options and changes offered through the plan.</p>
<p>4. Cash out the money and pay taxes and a 10 percent early-withdrawal
penalty.</p>
<p>worst thing you could possibly do</p>
<p>What about a Roth 401(k)?</p>
<p>allows you to contribute after-tax money to a 401(k) instead of
pre-tax money like a traditional 401(k).</p>
<p>If you expect your tax rates to be higher later in life, a Roth 401(k)
is a great option for you. T</p>
<p>no income restrictions</p>
<p>you can take any Roth 401(k) money and roll it over to a Roth IRA,
tax-free, which will give you even more investment options.</p>
<p>calculate how much you need to contribute to your 401(k) to get the
full match,</p>
<p>and then have it automatically deducted from your paycheck.</p>
<p>Crush Your Debt</p>
<p>The second step on the Ladder</p>
<p>The Beauty of Roth IRAs</p>
<p>Every person in their twenties should have a Roth IRA</p>
<p>lets you invest in whatever you want.</p>
<p>index funds, individual stocks, anything</p>
<p>you invest already-taxed income and you don’t pay any tax when you
withdraw it.</p>
<p>with a 401(k), you’re expected to treat a Roth IRA as a long-term
investment vehicle, and you’re penalized if you withdraw your earnings
before you’re 591/2 years old.</p>
<p>you can withdraw your principal</p>
<p>the amount you actually invested from your pocket) penalty-free</p>
<p>You qualify for these exceptions only if your Roth IRA has been open
for five years or more.</p>
<p>At present, the maximum you’re allowed to invest in your Roth IRA is
$5,500 a year, but you can find the most current amount by searching
“Roth IRA contribution limits.”</p>
<p>if you make more than $135,000 per year, there are restrictions on how
much you can contribute to a Roth IRA</p>
<p>To start a Roth IRA</p>
<p>first going to open an investment brokerage account with a trusted
investment company</p>
<p>Think of the “investment brokerage account” as your house and the Roth
IRA as one of the rooms</p>
<p>We’ll focus on discount brokerages like Vanguard because they charge
dramatically smaller fees than full-service brokerages like Morgan
Stanley. Full-service brokerages offer so-called “comprehensive
services,” but they basically just charge you a lot of money to sell
you useless research and let you talk to salespeople. Discount
brokerages, on the other hand, let you make the choices, charge only
small fees, and offer online access.</p>
<p>Recommended Discount Brokerages</p>
<p>Brokerage name</p>
<p>Minimum to open a Roth IRA</p>
<p>Things to know</p>
<p>Vanguard</p>
<p>vanguard.com</p>
<p>$1,000</p>
<p>My personal recommendation is Vanguard. They’re great because of their
relentless focus on low-cost funds. They don’t waive their minimums,
even with automatic investing, but the savings are well worth it. If
you want a Vanguard account but don’t have $1,000 to start, set it as
a savings goal.</p>
<p>Schwab</p>
<p>schwab.com</p>
<p>$1,000</p>
<p>Minimum is waived with $100 automatic monthly contribution. If you set
up a high-interest Schwab checking account, Schwab will automatically
link a brokerage account to it. Handy for automatic investing.</p>
<p>Fidelity</p>
<p>fidelity.com</p>
<p>$0</p>
<p>Fidelity launched a price war with a no-minimum account and $0 fee for
certain mutual funds. This is great for consumers and a promising sign
for where Fidelity is heading. However, their target date funds still
have higher expenses than Vanguard.</p>

<p>A Conscious Spending Plan involves four major buckets where your money
will go: fixed costs, investments, savings, and guilt-free spending
money.</p>

<p>You’ve heard me talk about the 85 Percent Solution, which focuses on
getting most of the way there—until it’s “good enough”—rather than
obsessing about achieving 100 percent, getting overwhelmed, and ending
up doing nothing at all. Well, Richard Jenkins, the former
editor-in-chief of MSN Money, wrote an article called “The 60 Percent
Solution,” which suggested that you split your money into simple
buckets, with the largest, basic expenses (food, bills, taxes), making
up 60 percent of your gross income. The remaining 40 percent would be
split four ways:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Retirement savings (10 percent)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Long-term savings (10 percent)</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Short-term savings for irregular expenses (10 percent)</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Fun money (10 percent)</p>
<p>The article has been widely distributed, although curiously, none of
my friends had heard of it. My Conscious Spending Plan relates to
Jenkins’s 60 Percent Solution, but it’s more focused toward young
people. We spend a huge amount on eating out and going out, whereas
our housing costs are lower because we can share apartments and rent
more comfortably than older people with families.</p>

<p>To get more prescriptive about your spending, I recommend using a
piece of software called You Need a Budget (youneedabudget.com) or
YNAB (I know, the name is ironic in this chapter where I talk about
how I hate budgets). YNAB lets you assign every dollar a “job,” like
“cell phone bill” or “guilt-free spending.” Use it for two weeks—just
two—and you’ll get incredible insight into your spending.</p>

<p>envelope system, in which you allocate money for certain categories
like eating out, shopping, rent, and so on. Once you spend the money
for that month, that’s it: You can’t spend more. If it’s really an
emergency, you can dip into other envelopes—like your “eating out”
envelope—but you’ll have to cut back until you replenish that
envelope. These “envelopes” can be figurative (like in YNAB or even
Excel) or literally envelopes that you put cash in. This is the best
system I’ve found for keeping spending simple and sustainable.</p>

<p>Log in to any regular payments you have, like cable, utilities, car
payments, or student loans, and set up automatic payments to occur on
the seventh of each month. I prefer to pay my bills using my credit
card, because I earn points, I get automatic consumer protection, and
I can easily track my spending using tools like You Need a Budget. But
if your merchant doesn’t accept credit cards, they should let you pay
the bill directly from your checking account, so set up an automatic
payment from there if need be.</p>

<p>7th of the month: <em>Automatic transfer to pay off your credit card.</em>
Log in to your credit card account and instruct it to draw money from
your checking account and pay the credit card bill on the seventh of
every month—in full. (Because your bill arrived on the first of the
month, you’ll never incur late fees using this system.) If you have
credit card debt and you can’t pay the bill in full, don’t worry. You
can still set up an automatic payment; just make it for the monthly
minimum or any other amount of your choice.</p>

<p>If you’re currently working with a financial adviser, I encourage you
to ask them if they are a fiduciary (i.e., if they’re required to put
your financial interests first). Joe’s adviser was not a fiduciary; he
was a salesman. That was instantly obvious by his recommendation that
Joe (a single man in his twenties) “invest” in life insurance. The
only reason for someone like Joe to have life insurance is if he has a
dependent—not to fatten his adviser’s wallet.</p>

<p>“passive management.” This is how index funds (a cousin of mutual
funds) are run. These funds work by replacing portfolio managers with
computers. The computers don’t attempt to find the hottest stock. They
simply and methodically pick the same stocks that an index holds—for
example, the five hundred stocks in the S&amp;P 500—in an attempt to
match the market. (An index is a way to measure part of the stock
market. For example, the NASDAQ index represents certain technology
stocks, while the S&amp;P 500 represents five hundred large US stocks.</p>

<p>investing, the way you distribute the investments in your portfolio
between stocks, bonds, and cash. In other words, by diversifying your
investments across different asset classes (like stocks and bonds or,
better yet, stock funds and bond funds), you can control the risk in
your portfolio—and therefore control how much money, on average,
you’ll lose due to volatility. It turns out that the way you allocate
your portfolio—whether it’s 100 percent stocks or 90 percent stocks
and 10 percent bonds—makes a profound difference on your returns.</p>

<p>It is important to diversify within stocks, but it’s even more
important to allocate across the different asset classes—like stocks

<p>Diversification is D for going deep into a category (for example,

<p>If you’re twenty-five years old and have dozens of years to grow your
money, a portfolio made up of mostly stock-based funds probably makes
sense. But if you’re older, retirement is coming up within a few
decades and you’ll want to tamp down your risk. Even if the market
tanks, you have control over your asset allocation. If you’re
older—especially if you’re in your sixties or older, for god’s sake—a
sizable portion of your portfolio should be in stable bonds.</p>

<p>Stocks and Bonds Have Many Flavors</p>
<p>Stocks</p>
<p>Bonds</p>
<p>Large-Cap</p>
<p>Big companies with a market capitalization (“market cap,” which is
defined as outstanding shares times the stock price) over $10 billion</p>
<p>Government</p>
<p>An ultra-safe investment that’s backed by the government. In exchange
for their low risk, government bonds tend to return less than stocks.</p>
<p>Mid-Cap</p>
<p>Midsized companies with a market cap between $1 billion and $5 billion</p>
<p>Corporate</p>
<p>A bond issued by a corporation. These tend to be riskier than
government bonds but safer than stocks.</p>
<p>Small-Cap</p>
<p>Smaller companies with a market cap less than $1 billion</p>
<p>Short-Term</p>
<p>Bonds with terms of usually less than three years</p>
<p>International investments</p>
<p>Stocks from companies in other countries, including emerging markets
(like China and India) and developed markets (like the United Kingdom
and Germany). Americans may sometimes buy these directly, but may have
to buy them through funds.</p>
<p>Long-Term</p>
<p>These bonds tend to mature in ten or more years and, accordingly,
offer higher yields than shorter-term bonds.</p>
<p>Growth</p>
<p>Stocks whose value may grow higher than other stocks, or even the
market as a whole</p>
<p>Municipal</p>
<p>Also known as “munis,” these are bonds issued by local governments</p>
<p>Value</p>
<p>Stocks that seem bargain priced (i.e., cheaper than they should be)</p>
<p>Inflation-Protected</p>
<p>Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, are ultra-safe
investments that protect against inflation.</p>
<p>Note that because of their complicated structure, REITs, “real estate
investment trusts”—which are types of investments that let you invest
in real estate through a single ticker symbol, just like a stock—don’t
neatly fall into any of these categories.</p>

<p>Basically, there are many types of stocks, and we need to own a little
of all of them. Same with bonds. This is called “diversifying,” and it

<div markdown="1">
he Rule of 72
</div>
<div markdown="1">
The Rule of 72 is a fast trick you can do to figure out how long it
will take to double your money. Here’s how it works: Divide the number
72 by the return rate you’re getting, and you’ll have the number of
years you must invest in order to double your money. (For the math
geeks among us, here’s the equation: 72 ÷ return rate = number of
years.) For example, if you’re getting a 10 percent return rate from
an index fund, it would take you a little more than seven years (72
divided by 10) to double your money. In other words, if you invested
$5,000 today, let it sit there, and earned a 10 percent return, you’d
have $10,000 in about seven years. And it doubles from there, too. Of
course, you could accumulate even more using the power of compounding
by adding more every month.

<p>30 percent—Domestic equities: US stock funds, including small-, mid-,
and large-cap stocks</p>
<p>15 percent—Developed-world international equities: funds from
developed foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany,
and France</p>
<p>5 percent—Emerging-market equities: funds from developing foreign
countries, such as China, India, and Brazil. These are riskier than
developed-world equities, so don’t go off buying these to fill 95
percent of your portfolio.</p>
<p>20 percent—Real estate investment trusts: also known as REITs. REITs
invest in mortgages and residential and commercial real estate, both
domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>15 percent—Government bonds: fixed-interest US securities, which
provide predictable income and balance risk in your portfolio. As an
asset class, bonds generally return less than stocks.</p>
<p>15 percent—Treasury inflation-protected securities: also known as
TIPS, these treasury notes protect against inflation. Eventually
you’ll want to own these, but they’d be the last ones I’d get after

Keep It Manageable

Q: *How many funds should I invest in?*
<p>A: If you’re wondering how many funds you should own, I’d encourage
you to keep it simple. Ideally you should have just one (a target date
fund). But if you’re picking your own index funds, as a general
guideline, you can create a great asset allocation using anywhere from
three to seven funds. That would cover domestic equities,
international equities, real estate investment trusts, and perhaps a
small allocation to treasury bonds. Remember, the goal isn’t to be
exhaustive and to own every single aspect of the market. It’s to
create an effective asset allocation and move on with your life.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>When you visit these websites, you’ll be able to research funds (you
may have to click “Products and Services” on many of the sites) to
make sure they’re low-cost and meet your asset allocation goals.</p>
<p>The first thing you want to do when picking index funds is to minimize
fees. Look for the management fees (“expense ratios”) to be low,
around 0.2 percent, and you’ll be fine. Most of the index funds at
Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Fidelity offer excellent value.</p>

allocation.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Third, note that you should absolutely look at how well the fund has
returned over the last ten or fifteen years, but remember that, as
they say, past performance is no guarantee of future results.</p>

<p>when you click “Products and Services” on most sites, you’ll be able
to find a fund screener that will let you add search filters like
“international index funds with an expense ratio of less than 0.75%”

<p>It’s important to maintain your automated financial system. Every
year, I spend a few hours re-reviewing my system and making any
changes necessary. For example, have I added subscriptions that I
don’t need anymore? Should I adjust my Conscious Spending Plan to
account for new short-term goals? Set aside some time every year—I
recommend December so you can start the next year off right—to go
through each of the steps below.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate your conscious spending plan (three hours)</strong> Use these as
general guidelines, but take them seriously: If your money is
following these suggested percentages, that’s a Big Win toward a Rich
Life.</p>
<p>☐  Fixed costs (50–60%)</p>
<p>☐  Investments (10%)</p>
<p>☐  Savings (5–10%)</p>
<p>☐  Guilt-Free Spending (20–35%)</p>
<p>☐  Reassess current subscriptions (cut if necessary).</p>
<p>☐  Renegotiate cable and internet bills.</p>
<p>☐  Revisit spending goals: Are they accurate? Are you actively saving
for them?</p>
<p>☐  If your fixed costs are too high, it may be time to look at a
cheaper rent (or AirBnB’ing a room out, or earning more).</p>
<p>☐  If you aren’t investing at least 10 percent, it’s worth finding the
money from somewhere else—usually guilt-free spending—and reallocating
it to investments.</p>
<p><strong>Negotiate any fees (two hours) &lt;/strongMany companies will
offer you introductory rates or lower your monthly fees if you ask.
Use my word-for-word scripts at iwillteachyoutoberich.com/negotiate.</p>

<p>Use the money in your retirement accounts. You can always withdraw the
principal you contributed to your Roth IRA penalty-free, although
you’ll be severely retarding your money’s ability to compound over
time. With a 401(k), you can take money out for “hardship
withdrawals,” which typically include medical expenses, buying a home,
tuition, preventing foreclosure, and funeral expenses, but you’ll
probably still pay early withdrawal fees.</p>

<p>I would consider a hybrid split, paying off your debt with part of
your money and investing with the rest. The exact split depends on
your risk tolerance. You could choose a fifty-fifty split to keep

invest more.</p>

<p>5. Negotiate for more than money. Don’t forget to discuss whether or

because top performers always want more, as it aligns them with the
company’s goals.</p>

<p>When I decided to buy—at the end of December, when salespeople are
desperate to meet their quotas—I reached out to seventeen car dealers
and told them exactly which car I wanted. I said I was prepared to buy
the car within two weeks and, because I knew exactly how much profit
they would make off the car, I would go with the lowest price offered
to me. The same day, as I sat back with a cup of Earl Grey tea and
three tacos with habanero salsa, responses started rolling in from the
dealers. After I had all the offers, I called the dealers, told them
the lowest price I’d received, and gave each of them a chance to beat
it. This resulted in a bidding war that led to a downward spiral of
near-orgasmic deals.</p>

<p>When you go through a traditional real estate agent, there are large
transaction fees—usually 6 percent of the selling price. Divide that
by just a few years, and it hits you a lot harder than if you had held
the house for ten or twenty years. There are also the costs associated
with moving. And depending on how you structure your sale, you may pay
a significant amount in taxes. The bottom line here: Buy only if
you’re planning to live in the same place for ten years or more.</p>

<p>Traditionally, you have to put 20 percent down. If you can’t save
enough to put 20 percent down, you’ll have to get something called
Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), which serves as insurance against

0.5 percent to 1 percent of the mortgage, plus an annual charge</p>
