    <description>These are the summaries and notes of books I have read. These notes are the result of wanting to further process books and retain information. After years of reading books one time and then forgetting most of them.&#xA;My current reading process Give the book a quick read through. Read the book a second time, highlighting anything I want to remember along the way. Read through highlights and try to distill key points in my own words, or just writing down words straight from the book that I want to remember. Share. Why I Read Physical Books</description>

      <description>Dopamine Nation (10/10) This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.</description>
