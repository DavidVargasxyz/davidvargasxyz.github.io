<p>Aprocess is any program, command, or application running on the system.
Every process has a unique numeric identifier, and it is managed by the
kernel through its entire lifespan. It may be viewed, listed, and
monitored, and can be launched at a non-default priority based on the
requirement and available computing resources. A process may also be
re-prioritized while it is running. A process is in one of several
states at any given time during its lifecycle. A process may be tied to
the terminal window where it is initiated, or it may run on the system
as a service.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>There are plenty of signals that may be passed to a process to
accomplish various actions. These actions include hard killing a
process, soft terminating it, and forcing it to restart with the same
identifier.</p>
<p>\</p>

<p>Job scheduling allows a user to schedule a command for a one-time or
recurring execution in the future. A job is submitted and managed by
authorized users only. All executed jobs are logged.</p>

<p>[]{#chapter0252.html}</p>
<h3 class="style3" id="processes-and-priorities">Processes and Priorities</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>A process is a unit for provisioning system resources. It is any
program, application, or command that runs on the system. A process is
created in memory when a program, application, or command is initiated.
Processes are organized in a hierarchical fashion. Each process has a
parent process (a.k.a. a calling process) that spawns it. A single
parent process may have one or many child processes and passes many of
its attributes to them at the time of their creation. Each process is
assigned an exclusive identification number known as the Process
IDentifier (PID), which is used by the kernel to manage and control the
process through its lifecycle. When a process completes its lifespan or
is terminated, this event is reported back to its parent process, and
all the resources provisioned to it (cpu cycles, memory, etc.) are then
freed and the PID is removed from the system.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Plenty of processes are spawned at system boot, many of which sit in the
memory and wait for an event to trigger a request to use their services.
These background system processes are called daemons and are critical to
system operation.</p>
<p>::: {style=&ldquo;page-break-before: always;&rdquo;}
:::</p>
<p>[]{#chapter0253.html}</p>
<h3 class="style3" id="process-states">Process States</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>A process changes its operating state multiple times during its
lifecycle. Many factors, such as load on the processor, availability of
free memory, priority of the process, and response from other
applications, affect how often a process jumps from one operating state
to another. It may be in a non-running condition for a while or waiting
for other process to feed it information so that it can continue to run.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>There are five basic process states: running, sleeping, waiting,
stopped, and zombie. Each process is in one state at any given time. See
Figure 8-1.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>::: {style=&ldquo;text-align: center;&rdquo;}

:::</p>
<p>Figure 8-1 Process State Transition</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Running: The process is being executed by the system CPU.</p>
<p>Sleeping: The process is waiting for input from a user or another
process.</p>
<p>Waiting: The process has received the input it was waiting for and is
now ready to run as soon as its turn comes.</p>
<p>Stopped: The process is currently halted and will not run even when its
turn comes unless a signal is sent to change its behavior. (Signals are
explained later in this chapter.)</p>
<p>Zombie: The process is dead. A zombie process exists in the process
table alongside other process entries, but it takes up no resources. Its
entry is retained until its parent process permits it to die. A zombie
process is also called a defunct process.</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="viewing-and-monitoring-processes-with-ps">Viewing and Monitoring Processes with ps</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>A system may have hundreds or thousands of processes running
concurrently depending on the purpose of the system. These processes may
be viewed and monitored using various native tools such as ps (process
status) and top (table of processes). The ps command offers plentiful
switches that influence its output, whereas top is used for real-time
viewing and monitoring of processes and system resources.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Without any options or arguments, ps lists processes specific to the
terminal where this command is issued:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-2T0S653J.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>The above output returns the elementary information about processes in
four columns. These processes are tied to the current terminal window.
It exhibits the PID, the terminal (TTY) the process spawned in, the
cumulative time (TIME) the system CPU has given to the process, and the
name of the actual command or program (CMD) being executed.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Some common options that can be used with the ps command to generate
detailed reports include -e (every), -f (full-format), -F (extra
full-format), and -l (long format). A combination of -e, -F, and -l (ps
-eFl) produces a very thorough process report, however, that much detail
may not be needed in most situations. Other common options such as
--forest and -x will report the output in tree-like hierarchy and
include the daemon processes as well. Check the manual pages of the
command for additional options and their usage.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Here are a few sample lines from the beginning and end of the output
when ps is executed with -e and -f flags on the system.</p>

<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-QQABWO1C.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>

<p>This output is disseminated across eight columns showing details about
every process running on the system. Table 8-1 describes the content
type of each column.</p>

<p>Table 8-1 ps Command Output Description</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The ps output above pinpoints several daemon processes running in the
background. These processes are not associated with any terminal, which
is why there is a ? in the TTY column. Notice the PID and PPID numbers.
The smaller the number, the earlier it is started. The process with PID
0 is started first at system boot, followed by the process with PID 1,
and so on. Each PID has an associated PPID in column 3. The owner of
each process is exposed in the UID column along with the name of the
command or program under CMD.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Information for each running process is recorded and maintained in the
/proc file system, which ps and many other commands reference to acquire
desired data for viewing.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The ps command output may be customized to view only the desired
columns. For instance, if you want to produce an output with the command
name in column 1, PID in column 2, PPID in column 3, and owner name in
column 4, run it as follows:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-P86YLM59.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>Make sure the -o option is specified for a user-defined format and there
is no white space before or after the column names. You can add or
remove columns and switch their positions as needed.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Another switch to look at with the ps command is -C (command list). This
option is used to list only those processes that match the specified
command name. For example, run it to check how many sshd processes are
currently running on the system:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-CQ26C6T5.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>The output exhibits multiple background sshd processes.</p>
<p>::: {style=&ldquo;page-break-before: always;&rdquo;}

<p>[]{#chapter0255.html}</p>
<h3 class="style3" id="viewing-and-monitoring-processes-with-top">Viewing and Monitoring Processes with top</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>The other popular tool for viewing process information is the top
command. This command displays statistics in real time and continuously,
and may be helpful in identifying possible performance issues on the
system. A sample of a running top session is shown below:</p>
<p>\</p>

<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-9U9PV626.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>Press q or Ctrl+c to quit.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The top output may be divided into two major portions: the summary
portion and the tasks portion. The summary area spreads over the first
five lines of the output, and it shows the information as follows:</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Line 1: Indicates the system uptime, number of users logged in, and
system load averages over the period of 1, 5, and 15 minutes. See the
description for the uptime command output in</p>
<p><a href="#chapter0049.html">Chapter 02 &ldquo;Initial Interaction with the System&rdquo;.</a></p>
<p>Line 2: Displays the task (or process) information, which includes the
total number of tasks running on the system and how many of them are in
running, sleeping, stopped, and zombie states.</p>
<p>Line 3: Shows the processor usage that includes the CPU time in
percentage spent in running user and system processes, in idling and
waiting, and so on.</p>
<p>Line 4: Depicts memory utilization that includes the total amount of
memory allocated to the system, and how much of it is free, in use, and
allocated for use in buffering and caching.</p>
<p>Line 5: Exhibits swap (virtual memory) usage that includes the total
amount of swap allocated to the system, and how much of it is free and
in use. The &ldquo;avail Mem&rdquo; shows an estimate of the amount of memory
available for starting new processes without using the swap.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The second major portion in the top command output showcases the details
for each process in 12 columns as described below:</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Columns 1 and 2: Pinpoint the process identifier (PID) and owner (USER)</p>
<p>Columns 3 and 4: Display the process priority (PR) and nice value (NI)</p>
<p>Columns 5 and 6: Depict amounts of virtual memory (VIRT) and non-swapped
resident memory (RES) in use</p>
<p>Column 7: Shows the amount of shareable memory available to the process
(SHR)</p>
<p>Column 8: Represents the process status (S)</p>
<p>Columns 9 and 10: Express the CPU (%CPU) and memory (%MEM) utilization</p>
<p>Column 11: Exhibits the CPU time in hundredths of a second (TIME+)</p>

<p>Though the tools discussed so far provide a lot of information about
processes including their PIDs, Linux also offers the pidof and pgrep
commands to list only the PID of a specific process. These commands have
a few switches available to modify their behavior; however, their most
elementary use is to pass a process name as an argument to view its PID.
For instance, to list the PID of the rsyslogd daemon, use either of the
following:</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="understanding-process-niceness-and-priority">Understanding Process Niceness and Priority</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>Linux is a multitasking operating system. It runs numerous processes on
a single processor core by giving each process a slice of time. The
process scheduler on the system performs rapid switching of processes,
giving the notion of concurrent execution of multiple processes.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>A process is spawned at a certain priority, which is established at
initiation based on a numeric value called niceness (a.k.a. a nice
value). There are 40 niceness values, with -20 being the highest or the
most favorable to the process, and +19 being the lowest or the least
favorable to the process. Most system-started processes run at the
default niceness of 0. A higher niceness lowers the execution priority
of a process, and a lower niceness increases it. In other words, a
process running at a higher priority gets more CPU attention. A child
process inherits the niceness of its calling process in its priority
calculation. Though programs are normally run at the default niceness,
you can choose to initiate them at a different niceness to adjust their
priority based on urgency, importance, or system load. As a normal user,
you can only make your processes nicer, but the root user can raise or
lower the niceness of any process.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>RHEL provides the nice command to launch a program at a non-default
priority and the renice command to alter the priority of a running
program.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The default niceness can be viewed with the nice command as follows:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-DZFM9QSL.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>The ps command with the -l option along with the -ef options can be used
to list priority (PRI, column 7) and niceness (NI, column 8) for all
processes:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-5QPXBUA4.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>The output indicates that the first two processes are running at the
default niceness of 0 and the next three at the highest niceness of -20.
These values are used by the process scheduler to adjust the execution
time of the processes on the CPU. The ps command maintains an internal
mapping between niceness levels and priorities. A niceness of 0 (NI
column) corresponds to priority 80 (PR column), and a niceness of -20
(NI column) maps to priority 60 (PR column).</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>In contrast to the niceness-priority mapping that the ps command uses,
the top command displays it differently. For a 0-80 ps mapping, the top
session will report it 0-20. Likewise, ps&rsquo; (-20)-60 will be the same as
the top&rsquo;s (-20)-0.</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="controlling-processes-with-signals">Controlling Processes with Signals</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>A system may have hundreds or thousands of processes running on it.
Sometimes it becomes necessary to alert a process of an event. This is
done by sending a control signal to the process. Processes may use
signals to alert each other as well. The receiving process halts its
execution as soon as it gets the signal and takes an appropriate action
as per the instructions enclosed in the signal. The instructions may
include terminating the process gracefully, killing it abruptly, or
forcing it to re-read its configuration.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>There are plentiful signals available for use, but only a few are
common. Each signal is associated with a unique numeric identifier, a
name, and an action. A list of available signals can be viewed with the
kill command using the -l option:</p>

<p>Table 8-2 Control Signals</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The commands used to pass a signal to a process are kill and pkill.
These commands are usually used to terminate a process. Ordinary users
can kill processes that they own, while the root user privilege is
needed to kill any process on the system.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The kill command requires one or more PIDs, and the pkill command
requires one or more process names to send a signal to. You can specify
a non-default signal name or number with either utility.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few examples to understand the usage of these tools.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>To pass the soft termination signal to the crond daemon, use either of
the following:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-36BT3VMP.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>
</div>
<p>The pidof command in the above example is used to discover the PID of
the crond process using command substitution and it is then passed to
the kill command for termination. You may also use the pgrep command to
determine the PID of a process, as demonstrated in the next example. Use
ps -ef | grep crond to confirm the termination.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Using the pkill or kill command without specifying a signal name or
number sends the default signal of 15 to the process. This signal may or
not terminate the process. Some processes ignore the soft termination
signal as they might be in a waiting state. These processes may be ended
forcefully using signal 9 in any of the following ways:</p>
<p>\</p>
<div>
<p><img src="davidvargasxyz.github.io/docs/images/image-Z7GDROPY.jpg" alt="">{height=&ldquo;100%&rdquo;}</p>

<p>You may run the killall command to terminate all processes that match a
criterion. Here is how you can use this command to kill all crond
processes (assuming there are many of them running):</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="job-scheduling">Job Scheduling</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>Job scheduling allows a user to submit a command for execution at a
specified time in the future. The execution of the command could be one
time or periodic based on a pre-determined time schedule. A one-time
execution may be scheduled for an activity that needs to be performed at
a time of low system usage. One example of such an activity would be the
execution of a lengthy shell program. In contrast, a recurring activity
could include creating a compressed archive, trimming log files,
monitoring the system, running a custom script, or removing unwanted
files from the system.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Job scheduling and execution is taken care of by two service daemons:
atd and crond. While atd manages the jobs scheduled to run one time in
the future, crond is responsible for running jobs repetitively at
pre-specified times. At startup, this daemon reads the schedules in
files located in the /var/spool/cron and /etc/cron.d directories, and
loads them in the memory for on-time execution. It scans these files at
short intervals and updates the in-memory schedules to reflect any
modifications. This daemon runs a job at its scheduled time only and
does not entertain any missed jobs. In contrast, the atd daemon retries
a missed job at the same time next day. For any additions or changes,
neither daemon needs a restart.</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="controlling-user-access">Controlling User Access</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>By default, all users are allowed to schedule jobs using the at and cron
services. However, this access may be controlled and restricted to
specific users only. This can be done by listing users in the allow or
deny file located in the /etc directory for either service. These files
are named at.allow and at.deny for the at service and cron.allow and
cron.deny for the cron service.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The syntax for the four files is identical. You only need to list
usernames that are to be allowed or denied access to these scheduling
tools. Each file takes one username per line. The root user is always
permitted; it is affected neither by the existence or non-existence of
these files nor by the inclusion or exclusion of its entry in these

<h3 class="style3" id="using-crontab">Using crontab</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>Using the crontab command is the other method for scheduling tasks for
running in the future. Unlike atd, crond executes cron jobs on a regular
basis if they comply with the format defined in the /etc/crontab file.
Crontables (another name for crontab files) are located in the
/var/spool/cron directory. Each authorized user with a scheduled job has
a file matching their login name in this directory.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>For example, the crontable for user1 would be /var/spool/cron/user1. The
other two locations where system crontables can be stored are the
/etc/crontab file and the /etc/cron.d directory; however, only the root
user is allowed to create, modify, and delete them. The crond daemon
scans entries in the files at the three locations to determine job
execution schedules. The daemon runs the commands or programs at the
specified time and adds a log entry to the /var/log/cron file for each
invocation. There is no need to restart the daemon after submitting a
new or modifying an existing cron job.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The crontab command is used to edit (-e), list (-l), and remove (-r)
crontables. The -u option is also available for users who wish to modify
a different user&rsquo;s crontable, provided they are allowed to do so and the
other user is listed in the cron.allow file. The root user can also use
the -u flag to alter other users&rsquo; crontables even if the affected users
are not listed in the allow file. By default, crontab files are opened
in the vim editor when the crontab command is issued to edit them.</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="syntax-of-user-crontables">Syntax of User Crontables</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>The /etc/crontab file specifies the syntax that each user cron job must
comply with in order for crond to interpret and execute it successfully.
Based on this structure, each line in a user crontable with an entry for
a scheduled job is comprised of six fields. Fields 1 to 5 are for the
schedule, field 6 may contain the login name of the executing user, and
the rest for the command or program to be executed. See Figure 8-2 for
the syntax.</p>

<p>Furthermore, step values may be used with * and ranges in the
crontables using the forward slash character (/). Step values allow the
number of skips for a given value. For example, */2 in the minute field
would mean every second minute, */3 would mean every third minute,
0-59/4 would mean every fourth minute, and so on. Step values are also
supported in the same format in fields 2 to 5.</p>

<p>This exercise should be done on server1 as user1 with sudo where
required.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>For this exercise, assume that all users are currently denied access to
cron.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will submit a cron job as user1 to echo &ldquo;Hello,
this is a cron test.&rdquo;. You will schedule this command to execute at
every fifth minute past the hour between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on
the fifth and twentieth of every month. You will have the output
redirected to the /tmp/hello.out file, list the cron entry, and then
remove it.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>1. Edit the /etc/cron.allow file and add user1 to it:</p>

<h3 class="style3" id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>\</p>
<p>This chapter discussed two major topics: process management and job
scheduling.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>It is vital for users, developers, and administrators alike to have a
strong grasp on running processes, resources they are consuming, process
owners, process execution priorities, etc. They should learn how to list
processes in a variety of ways. We looked at the five states a process
is in at any given time during its lifecycle. We examined the concepts
of niceness and reniceness for increasing or decreasing a process&rsquo;s
priority. We analyzed some of the many available signals and looked at
how they could be passed to running processes to perform an action on
them.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The second and the last topic talked about submitting and managing tasks
to run in the future one time or on a recurring basis. We learned about
the service daemons that handle the task execution and the control files
where we list users who can or cannot submit jobs. We looked at the log
file that stores information for all executed jobs. We reviewed the
syntax of the crontable and examined a variety of date/time formats for
use with both at and cron job submission. We performed two exercises to
gain a grasp on their usage.</p>
