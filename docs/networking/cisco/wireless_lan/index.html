<p>Connecting a Cisco WLC</p>
<p>Cisco wireless controllers differ a bit; ports and interfaces refer to different concepts.</p>
<p>Controller ports are physical connections made to an external wired or switched network, whereas interfaces are logical connections made internally within the controller</p>
<p>Using WLC Ports</p>
<p>Service port: Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot functions; always connects to a switch port in access mode</p>
<p>Distribution system port: Used for all normal AP and management traffic; usually connects to a switch port in 802.1Q trunk mode</p>
<p>Console port: Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot functions; asynchronous connection to a terminal emulator (9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, by default)</p>
<p>Redundancy port: Used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation</p>
<p>Controllers can have a single service port that must be connected to a switched network. Usually, the service port is assigned to a management VLAN so that you can access the controller with SSH or a web browser to perform initial configuration or for maintenance. Notice that the service port supports only a single VLAN, so the corresponding switch port must be configured for access mode only.</p>
<p>Controllers also have multiple distribution system ports that you must connect to the network. These ports carry most of the data coming to and going from the controller. For example, the CAPWAP tunnels (control and data) that extend to each of a controller’s APs pass across the distribution system ports. Client data also passes from wireless LANs to wired VLANs over the ports. In addition, any management traffic using a web browser, SSH, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and so on, normally reaches the controller in-band through the ports.</p>
<p>the distribution system ports always operate in 802.1Q trunking mode.</p>
<p>The distribution system ports can operate independently, each one transporting multiple VLANs to a unique group of internal controller interfaces. For resiliency, you can configure distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup port is used instead.</p>
<p>Controller distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that they are bundled together to act as one larger link</p>
<p>traffic can be load-balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG</p>
<p>LAG offers resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be redirected to the remaining working ports instead.</p>
<p>Cisco WLCs do not support any link aggregation negotiation protocol, like LACP or PAgP, at all.</p>
<p>Using WLC Interfaces</p>
<p>the controller must somehow map those wired VLANs to equivalent logical wireless networks</p>
<p>VLAN must be connected to a unique wireless LAN that exists on a controller and its associated APs.</p>
<p>Cisco wireless controllers provide the necessary connectivity through internal logical interfaces, which must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Each interface is then assigned to a physical port and a VLAN ID. You can think of an interface as a Layer 3 termination on a VLAN.</p>
<p>Cisco controllers support the following interface types:</p>
<p>Management interface: Used for normal management traffic, such as RADIUS user authentication, WLC-to-WLC communication, web-based and SSH sessions, SNMP, Network Time Protocol (NTP), syslog, and so on. The management interface is also used to terminate CAPWAP tunnels between the controller and its APs.</p>
<p>Redundancy management: The management IP address of a redundant WLC that is part of a high availability pair of controllers. The active WLC uses the management interface address, while the standby WLC uses the redundancy management address.</p>
<p>Virtual interface: IP address facing wireless clients when the controller is relaying client DHCP requests, performing client web authentication, and supporting client mobility.</p>
<p>Service port interface: Bound to the service port and used for out-of-band management.</p>
<p>Dynamic interface: Used to connect a VLAN to a WLAN.</p>

<p>The management interface faces the switched network, where management users and APs are located. Management traffic will usually consist of protocols like HTTPS, SSH, SNMP, NTP, TFTP, and so on</p>
<p>consists of CAPWAP packets that carry control and data tunnels to and from the APs.</p>
<p>The virtual interface is used only for certain client-facing operations.</p>
<p>when a wireless client issues a request to obtain an IP address, the controller can relay the request on to an actual DHCP server that can provide the appropriate IP address</p>
<p>DHCP server appears to be the controller’s virtual interface address. Clients may see the virtual interface’s address, but that address is never used when the controller communicates with other devices on the switched network.</p>
<p>Because the virtual interface is used only for some client management functions, you should configure it with a unique, nonroutable address. For example, you might use 10.1.1.1 because it is within a private address space defined in RFC 1918.</p>
<p>The virtual interface address is also used to support client mobility.</p>
<p>every controller that exists in the same mobility group should be configured with a virtual address that is identical to the others. By using one common virtual address, all the controllers will appear to operate as a cluster as clients roam from controller to controller.</p>
<p>Dynamic interfaces map WLANs to VLANs,</p>
<p>making the logical connections between wireless and wired networks. You will configure one dynamic interface for each wireless LAN that is offered by the controller’s APs and then map the interface to the WLAN.</p>
<p>Each dynamic interface must also be configured with its own IP address and can act as a DHCP relay for wireless clients. To filter traffic passing through a dynamic interface, you can configure an optional access list.</p>

<p>The controller will bind the WLAN to one of its interfaces and then push the WLAN configuration out to all of its APs by default.</p>
<p>Like VLANs, you can use WLANs to segregate wireless users and their traffic into logical networks. Users associated with one WLAN cannot cross over into another one unless their traffic is bridged or routed from one VLAN to another through the wired network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cisco controllers support a maximum of 512 WLANs, but only 16 of them can be actively configured on an AP.</p>
<p>Advertising each WLAN to potential wireless clients uses up valuable airtime.</p>
<p>Every AP must broadcast beacon management frames at regular intervals to advertise the existence of a BSS</p>
<p>Beacons are normally sent 10 times per second, or once every 100 ms, at the lowest mandatory data rate</p>
<p>if you create too many WLANs, a channel can be starved of any usable airtime</p>
<p>always limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer; a maximum of three WLANs is best</p>
<p>Before you create a new WLAN, think about the following parameters it will need to have:</p>
<p>SSID string</p>
<p>Controller interface and VLAN number</p>
<p>Type of wireless security needed</p>
<p>you will create the appropriate dynamic controller interface to support the new WLAN; then you will enter the necessary WLAN parameters</p>
<p>Step 1. Configure a RADIUS Server</p>
<p>RADIUS server, such as WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3-Enterprise,</p>
<p>Select Security &gt; AAA &gt; RADIUS &gt; Authentication to see a list of servers that have already been configured</p>
<p>If multiple servers are defined, the controller will try them in sequential order. Click New to create a new server.</p>

• web</p>
<p>Next, enter the server’s IP address, shared secret key, and port number Because the controller already had two other RADIUS servers configured, the server at 192.168.200.30 will be index number 3. Be sure to set the server status to Enabled so that the controller can begin using it. At the bottom of the page, you can select the type of user that will be authenticated with the server. Check Network User to authenticate wireless clients or Management to authenticate wireless administrators that will access the controller’s management functions. Click Apply to complete the server configuration.</p>

<p>Next, enter the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address for the interface. You should also define primary and secondary DHCP server addresses that the controller will use when it relays DHCP requests from clients that are bound to the interface</p>
<p>Click the Apply button to complete the interface configuration and return to the list of interfaces.</p>

<p>Step 3. Create a New WLAN</p>
<p>selecting WLANs from the top menu bar (displays current WLANs)</p>
<p>You can create a new WLAN by selecting Create New from the drop-down menu and then clicking the Go button.</p>
<p>Next, enter a descriptive name as the profile name and the SSID text string.</p>
<p>The ID number is used as an index into the list of WLANs that are defined on the controller. The ID number becomes useful when you use templates in Prime Infrastructure (PI) to configure WLANs on multiple controllers at the same time.</p>
<p>CISCO
KLAN s</p>
<p>WLAN templates are applied to specific WLAN ID numbers on controllers. The WLAN ID is only locally significant and is not passed between controllers. As a rule, you should keep the sequence of WLAN names and IDs consistent across multiple controllers so that any configuration templates you use in the future will be applied to the same WLANs on each controller.</p>
<p>Click the Apply button to create the new WLAN. The next page will allow you to edit four categories of parameters, corresponding to the tabs across the top</p>
<p>WLANS •Enginering</p>
<p>You can control whether the WLAN is enabled or disabled with the Status check box</p>
<p>Under Radio Policy, select the type of radio that will offer the WLAN. By default, the WLAN will be offered on all radios that are joined with the controller. You can select a more specific policy with 802.11a only, 802.11a/g only, 802.11g only, or 802.11b/g only.</p>
<p>Next, select which of the controller’s dynamic interfaces will be bound to the WLAN. By default, the management interface is selected. The drop-down list contains all the interface names that are available</p>
<p>Finally, use the Broadcast SSID check box to select whether the APs should broadcast the SSID name in the beacons they transmit.</p>
<p>Hiding the SSID name, by not broadcasting it, does not really provide any worthwhile security</p>
<p>Configuring WLAN Security</p>
<p>Select the Security tab to configure the security settings. By default, the Layer 2 Security tab is selected. From the Layer 2 Security drop-down menu, select the appropriate security scheme to use. Table 29-2 lists the types that are available.</p>

<p>To use WPA2-Enterprise, the 802.1X option would be selected. In that case, 802.1x and EAP would be used to authenticate wireless clients against one or more RADIUS servers.</p>
<p>To specify which servers the WLAN should use, you would select the Security tab and then the AAA Servers tab in the WLAN edit screen. You can identify up to six specific RADIUS servers in the WLAN configuration. Beside each server, select a specific server IP address from the drop-down menu of globally defined servers. The servers are tried in sequential order until one of them responds</p>

<p>By default, a controller will contact a RADIUS server from its management interface. You can override this behavior by checking the box next to Radius Server Overwrite Interface so that the controller sources RADIUS requests from the dynamic interface that is associated with the WLAN.</p>
<p>Configuring WLAN QoS</p>
<p>Select the QoS tab to configure quality of service settings for the WLAN</p>
<p>By default, the controller will consider all frames in the WLAN to be normal data, to be handled in a “best effort” manner. You can set the Quality of Service (QoS) drop-down menu to classify all frames in one of the following ways:</p>
<p>Platinum (voice)</p>
<p>Gold (video)</p>
<p>Silver (best effort)</p>
<p>Bronze (background)</p>
<p>You can also set the Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) policy, call admission control (CAC) policies, and bandwidth parameters on the QoS page</p>
<p>Configuring Advanced WLAN Settings</p>
<p>Advanced Tab</p>
<p>can enable functions such as coverage hole detection, peer-to-peer blocking, client exclusion, client load limits, and so on.</p>

<p>By default, client sessions with the WLAN are limited to 1800 seconds (30 minutes). Once that session time expires, a client will be required to reauthenticate. This setting is controlled by the Enable Session Timeout check box and the Timeout field.</p>
<p>all clients are subject to the policies configured under Security &gt; Wireless Protection Policies &gt; Client Exclusion Policies. These policies include excessive 802.11 association failures, 802.11 authentication failures, 802.1x authentication failures, web authentication failures, and IP address theft or reuse. Offending clients will be automatically excluded or blocked for 60 seconds, as a deterrent to attacks on the wireless network.</p>

<p>by default, a controller will not allow management traffic that is initiated from a WLAN. That means you (or anybody else) cannot access the controller GUI or CLI from a wireless device that is associated to the WLAN. This is considered to be a good security practice because the controller is kept isolated from networks that might be easily accessible or where someone might eavesdrop on the management session traffic</p>
