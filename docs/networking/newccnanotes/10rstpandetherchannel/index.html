RSTP and RPVST+ use different destination MAC addresses: RSTP with multicast address 0180.C200.0000 (an address defined in the IEEE standard), and RPVST+ with multicast address 0100.0CCC.CCCD (an address chosen

When transmitting messages on VLAN trunks, RSTP sends the messages in the native VLAN with no VLAN header/tag. RPVST+ sends each VLAN’s messages inside that VLAN—for instance, BPDUs about VLAN 9 have an

Configuring Dynamic EtherChannels<br>
Cisco switches also support two different configuration options that then use a dynamic protocol to negotiate whether a particular link becomes part of an EtherChannel or not. Basically, the configuration<br>
enables a protocol for a particular channelto send messages to/from the neighboring switch and discover whether their configuration settings pass -group number. At that point, the switch can use the protocol<br>
all checks. If a given physical link passes, the link is added to the EtherChannel and used; if not, it is placed in a down state, and not used, until the configuration inconsistency can be resolved.<br>
Most Cisco Catalyst switches support thestandard Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),Cisco-proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and the IEEE<br>
negotiate so that only links that pass the configuration checks are actually used in an EtherChannel.<br>

▪STP interface settings<br>
switches check the settings on the neighboring switch. To do so, the switches either use PAgP or LACP (if already in use) or use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) if using manual configuration. When checking<br>
neighbors, all settings except the STP settings must match.</p>

Configuration options for EtherChannel Load Distribution<br>
EtherChannel load distribution makes the choice for each frame based on various numeric values found in the Layer 2, 3, and 4 headers. The process uses one configurable setting as input: the load distribution<br>
