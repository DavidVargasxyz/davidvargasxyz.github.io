<p>Designs like Figure 14-4, with multiple E-Line services on a single access link, use 802.1Q trunking, with a different VLAN ID for each E-Line service. As a result, the router configuration can use a typical router configuration with trunking and subinterfaces.</p>

allow the SP to build one large MPLS network, which also creates a private IP-based WAN for each  
of its customers.  
The routers on the edge of the MPLS network add and remove an MPLS header to packets as they enter and exit the MPLS network.The devices inside the MPLS network then use the label field  
inside that MPLS header when forwarding data across the MPLS network. The choices of the labels  
to use, along with other related logic, allow the MPLS VPN to create separate VPNs to keep different customers’ traffic separate.

DSL modem sends and receives the data, as digital signals, at higher frequencies, over the
same local loop
Because DSL sends analog (voice) and digital (data) signals on the same line, the telco has to somehow split those signals on the telco side of the connection. To do so, the local loop
must be connected to a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the nearby telco central office (CO). TheDSLAM splits out the digital data over to the router on the lower right in
Figure 14-17, which completes the connection to the Internet. The DSLAM also splits out the
analog voice signals over to the voice switch on the upper right.</p>

Site-to-Site VPNs withIpsec  
an architecture or framework for security services for IP networks  
more generally called IP Security  
IPsec defines how two devices, both of which connect to the Internet, can achieve the main goals  
of a VPN as listed at the beginning of this section: confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, and anti-replay  
its role as an architecture allows it to be added to and changed over time as improvements to  
individual security functions are made.  
IPsec encryption uses a pair of encryption algorithms, which are essentially math formulas, to  
meet a couple of requirements  
One to hide (encrypt) the data  
Another to re-create (decrypt) the original data based on the encrypted data  
if an attacker did happen to decrypt one packet, that information would not give the attacker any  
advantages in decrypting the other packets.

The sending device sends this new packet to the destination VPN device (FW1 back in Figure 14-21).
