if you then enabled OSPF on the Layer 3 switch, the configuration and verification would work the same as it does on a router, as discussed in Chapter 20, “Implementing OSPF.” The routes that IOS adds to the  
Layer 3 switch’s IP routing table would list the VLAN interfaces as outgoing interfaces.  
Troubleshooting Routing with SVIs  
look to those first few configuration commands listed in the configuration checklist found in the  
earlier section “Configuring Routing Using Switch SVIs.” Those commands are (followed by a reload) and then ip routing(after the reload). sdm prefer

access switches that support Layer 3 switching still have an SDM default that does not allocate space for an IP routing table. Once changed and reloaded, the **ip routing** command then enables  
IPv4 routing in IOS software. Both are necessary before some Cisco switches will act as a Layer 3 switch.  
Scenario 1: The last access interface in VLAN 10 is shut down (F0/1), so IOS shuts down the VLAN 10 interface.  
Scenario 2: VLAN 20 (not VLAN interface 20, but VLAN 20) is deleted, which results in IOS then  
bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 20 interface.  
Scenario 3: VLAN 30 (not VLAN interface 30, but VLAN 30) is shut down, which results in IOS then  
bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 30 interface.  
VLAN Routing with Layer 3 Switch Routed Ports

Step 2. Configure the PortChannel interface:  
A. Use thefor the same channel number configured on the physical interfaces. **interface port-channel number** command to move to port-channel configuration mode

B. Add the port. (IOS may have already added this command.) **no switchport** command to make sure that the port-channel interface acts as a routed

C. Use the **ip address address mask** command to configure the address and mask.  
Cisco uses the term EtherChannel in concepts discussed in this section and then uses the term PortChannel, with command keyword port-channel, when verifying and configuring  
EtherChannels.

although the physical interfaces and PortChannel interface are all routed ports,should be placed on the PortChannel interface only. In fact,when the no switchport command is the IP address  
configured on an interface, IOS adds the no ip address command to the interface.

Troubleshooting Layer 3 EtherChannels
</code></pre><p>look at the configuration of the EtherChannel. Second, you should check a list of settings that must match on the interfaces for a channel-group command, which enables an interface for an
Layer 3 EtherChannel to work correctly.
As for the channel-group interface subcommand, this command can enable EtherChannel
statically or dynamically. If dynamic, this command’s keywords imply either Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as the protocol to negotiate between
the neighboring switches whether they put the link into the EtherChannel.
no switchportand so must the physical interfaces. : The PortChannel interface must be configured with the no switchport command,
Speed: The physical ports in the channel must use the same speed.
duplex: The physical ports in the channel must use the same duplex.</p>

Problem Isolation Using the ping Command  
functions as part of Layer 3, as a control protocol to assist IP by helping manage the IP network  
functions.  
The name or IP address of the destination, how many times the command should send an echo request,  
how long the command should wait (timeout) for an echo reply,how big to make the packets, and many other options.

- LAN switch port security that filters A’s frames (based on A’s MAC address)
- IP routes on routers that happen to match host A’s 172.16.1.51 address, with different routes that match R1’s 172.16.1.1 address
- Problems with host A’s default router setting

The host with address 172.16.1.51 replied.
The LAN can pass unicast frames from R1 to host 172.16.1.51 and vice versa.
You can reasonably assume that the switches learned the MAC addresses of the router and
the host, adding those to the MAC address tables.
Host A and Router R1 completed the ARP process and list each other in their respective Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables.</p>

- **IP addressing problem:DHCP problems:** If you are using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), many problems Host A could be statically configured with the wrong IP address.  
    could exist.
- **VLAN trunking problems:** The router could be configured for 802.1Q trunking, when the switch is  
    not (or vice versa).
- **LAN problems:** A wide variety of issues could exist with the Layer 2 switches, preventing any  
    frames from flowing between host A and the router.

Testing LAN Neighbors with Extended Ping  
an extended ping can test the host’s default router setting. Both tests can be useful, especially for  
problem isolation, because

- If a standard ping of a local LAN host works...
- • But an extended ping of the same LAN host fails...The problem likely relates somehow to the host’s default router setting.

Testing WAN Neighbors with Standard Ping
</code></pre><p>A successful ping of the IP address on the other end of an Ethernet WAN link that sits between two routers confirms several specific facts, such as the following:
Both routers’ WAN interfaces are in an up/up state.
The Layer 1 and 2 features of the link work.
The routers believe that the neighboring router’s IP address is in the same subnet.
Inbound ACLs on both routers do not filter the incoming packets, respectively.
The remote router is configured with the expected IP address (172.16.4.2 in this case).</p>

###### Using Ping with Names and with IP Addresses

Problem Isolation Using the traceroute Command  
ping vs Tracert

- Both send messages in the network to test connectivity.

- • Both send messages in the network to test connectivity.Both rely on other devices to send back a reply.
- • Both have wide support on many different operating systems.Both can use a hostname or an IP address to identify the destination.
- On routers, both have a standard and extended version, allowing better testing of the reverse route.  
    Standard and Extended traceroute  
    a standardthe packet sent by the command. So, in this example, the packets sent by R1 come from **traceroute** command chooses an IP address based on the outgoing interface for  
    source IP address 172.16.4.1, R1’s G0/0/0 IP address.

Host OS traceroute commands usually create ICMP echo requests.TheCisco IOS traceroute  
command instead creates IP packets with a UDP headertrivial at this point. However, note that an ACL may actually filter the traffic from a host’s. This bit of information may seem  
traceroute messages but not the router traceroute command, or vice versa.
