      <description>I couldn’t find a guide on how to set up Calibre web step-by-step as a Docker container. Especially not one that used Nginx as a reverse proxy.&#xA;The good news is that it is really fast and simple. You’ll need a few tools to get this done:&#xA;A server with a public IP address A DNS Provider (I use CloudFlare) Docker Nginx A Calibre Library Certbot Rsync First, sync your local Calibre library to a folder on your server:</description>

      <description>Word Press is great, but it is probably a lot more bloated then you need for a personal website. Enter Hugo, it has less server capacity and storage needs than Word Press. Hugo is a static site generator than takes markdown files and converts them to html.&#xA;Hosting your own website is also a lot cheaper than having a provider like Bluehost do it for you. Instead of $15 per month, I am currently paying $10 per year.</description>

      <description>This is a step-by-step guide to setting up Nextcloud on a Debian server. You will need a server hosted by a VPS like Vultr. And a Domain hosted by a DNS provider such as Cloudflare&#xA;What is Nextcloud? Nextcloud is so many things. It offers so many features and options, it deserves a bulleted list:&#xA;Free and open source Cloud storage and syncing Email client Custom browser dashboard with widgets Office suite RSS newsfeed Project organization (deck) Notebook Calender Task manager Connect to decentralized social media (like Mastodon) Replacement for all of google’s services Create web forms or surveys It is also free and open source. This mean the source code is available to all. And hosting yourself means you can guarantee that your data isn’t being shared.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is software that lets you set up multiple, pre-configured virtual machines in a flash. I am going to show you how to do this using Linux and Virtual Box. But you can do this on MacOS and Windows as well.&#xA;Download Vagrant, VirtualBox and Git.&#xA;Vagrant link.&#xA;Virtualbox link.&#xA;You may want to follow another tutorial for setting up VirtualBox.&#xA;Git link.&#xA;Installing git will install ssh on windows.
