<p><a href="Dopamine%20Nation.md">Dopamine Nation</a> (10/10)</p>
<p>This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.</p>

<p><a href="The%20Psychology%20of%20Money.md">The Psychology of Money</a> (10/10)</p>
<p>Holy cow was this eye opening. Not only in regards to money, but the principles apply to many aspects of life. Strong story telling, clear and concise. Worth reading multiple times.</p>

The author even explains why aversive training not only doesn&rsquo;t work, but it makes problems sprout up in other areas of your dogs life. Loaded with how-to&rsquo;s on all of the basic things you should treat your dogs and dealing with common problems.</p>

<p>I took a lot of highlights with this one. Motivational, inspiring, and practical. I will be coming back to these notes over and over as I embark on my business ventures. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for what you want. In fact, develop your asking powers like a muscle. Also, don&rsquo;t try to figure out how to do something before you start. Just start and figure out how along the way.</p>

<p><a href="The%2012%20Week%20Year.md">The 12 Week Year</a> (8/10)</p>
<p>This second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action.</p>
<p>I have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I&rsquo;ve got down the process.</p>
<p>I highly advise you make your own outline so you do not have to read everything &ldquo;twice again&rdquo;.</p>
