Local User Authentication Files Three supported account types: root, normal, service root has full access to all services and administrative functions on the system. created by default during installation. Normal user-level privileges cannot perform any administrative functions can run applications and programs that have been authorized. Service take care of their respective services, which include apache, ftp, mail, and chrony. User account information for local users is stored in four files that are located in the /etc directory. passwd, shadow, group, and gshadow (user authentication files) updated when a user or group account is created, modified, or deleted. referenced to check and validate the credentials for a user at the time of their login attempt, system creates their automatic backups by default as passwd-, shadow-, group-, and gshadow- in the /etc directory. /etc/passwd vital user login data each row hold info for one user 644 permissions by default 7 feilds per row login name up to 255 characters _ and - characters are supported not recommended to include special characters and uppercase letters in login names. password “x” in this field points to /etc/shadow for actual password. “*” identifies disabled account Can also include a hashed password (RHEL uses SHA-512 by default) UID Number between 0 and 4.2 billion UID 0 is reserved for root account UIDs 1-200 are used by Red Hat for core service accounts UIDs 201-999 are reserved for non-core service accounts UIDs 1000 &lt; are for normal user accounts (starts at 1000 by default) GID GID that matches entry in /etc/group (primary group) Group for every user by default that matches UID Comments (GECOS) or (GCOS) general comments about the user Home Directory absolute path to the user home directory. Shell absolute path of the shell file for the user’s primary shell after logging in. (default = (/bin/bash)) /etc/shadow no access permissions for any user (even root) (but owned by root) secure password control (shadow password) user passwords are hashed and stored in a more secure file /etc/shadow, limits on user passwords in terms of expiration, warning period, etc. applied on per-user basis limits and other settings are defined in /etc/login.defs user is initially checked in the passwd file for existence and then in the shadow file for authenticity. contains user authentication and password aging information. Each row in the file corresponds to one entry in the passwd file. login names are used as a common key between the shadow and passwd files. nine colon-separated fields per line entry. 1 Login name 2 Encrypted password ! at the beginning of this field shows that the user account is locked if field is empty then user has passwordless entry 3 last change Number of days (lastchg) since the UNIX epoch, (UNIX time (January 01, 1970 00:00:00 UTC) when the password was last modified. Empty field represents the passiveness of password aging features. 0 forces the user to change their password upon next login. 4 minimum number of days (mindays) that must elapse before the user is allowed to change their password can be altered using the chage command with the -m option or the passwd command with the -n option. 0 or null in this field disables this feature. 5 (Maximum) maximum number of days (maxdays) before the user password expires and must be changed. may be altered using the chage command with the -M option or the passwd command with the -x option. null value here disables this feature along with other features such as the maximum password age, warning alerts, and the user inactivity period. 6 Field 6 (Warning) number of days (warndays) the user gets warnings for changing their password before it expires. may be altered using the chage command with the -W option or the passwd command with the -w option. 0 or null in this field disables this feature. 7 Password Expiry) maximum allowable number of days for the user to be able to log in with the expired password. (inactivity period). may be altered using the chage command with the -I option or the passwd command with the -i option. empty field disables this feature. 8 (Account Expiry) number of days since the UNIX time when the user account will expire and no longer be available. may be altered using the chage command with the -E option. empty field disables this feature. 9 (Reserved): Reserved for future use. /etc/group plaintext file and contains critical group information. 644 permissions by default and owned by root. Each row in the file stores information for one group entry. Every user on the system must be a member of at least one group (User Private Group (UPG)). a group name matches the username it is associated with by default four colon-separated fields per line entry. Field 1 (Group Name): Holds a group name that must begin with a letter. Group names with up to 255 characters, including the uppercase, underscore (_) and hyphen (-) characters, are also supported. (not recommended) Field 2 (Encrypted Password): Can be empty or contain an “x” (points to the /etc/gshadow file for the actual password), or a hashed group-level password. can set a password on a group for non-members to be able to change their group identity temporarily using the newgrp command. non-members must enter the correct password in order to do so. Field 3 (GID): Holds a GID, that is also placed in the GID field of the passwd file. By default, groups are created with GIDs starting at 1000 and with the same name as the username. system allows several users to belong to a single group also allows a single user to be a member of multiple groups at the same time. Field 4 (Group Members): Lists the membership for the group. (user’s primary group is always defined in the GID field of the passwd file.) /etc/gshadow no access permissions for any user (even root) group passwords are hashed and stored group names are used as a common key between the gshadow and group files. 000 permissions and owned by root four colon-separated fields Field 1 (Group Name): Consists of a group name as appeared in the group file. Field 2 (Encrypted Password): Can contain a hashed password, which may be set with the gpasswd command for non-group members to access the group temporarily using the newgrp command. single exclamation mark (!) or a null value in this field allows group members password-less access and restricts non-members from switching into this group. Field 3 (Group Administrators): Lists usernames of group administrators that are authorized to add or remove members with the gpasswd command. Field 4 (Members): comma-separated list of members. gpasswd command: - add group administrators. - add or delete group members. - assign or revoke a group-level password. - disable the ability of the newgrp command to access a group. - picks up the default values from the /etc/login.defs file. useradd and login.defs configuration files useradd command picks up the default values from the /etc/default/useradd and /etc/login.defs files for any options that are not specified at the command line when executing it. login.defs file is also consulted by the usermod, userdel, chage, and passwd commands Both files store several defaults including those that affect the password length and password lifecycle. /etc/default/useradd Default Directives: starting GID (GROUP) (provided the USERGROUPS_ENAB directive in the login.defs file is set to no) home directory location (HOME), number of inactivity days between password expiry and permanent account disablement (INACTIVE), account expiry date (EXPIRE), login shell (SHELL), skeleton directory location to copy user initialization files from (SKEL) whether to create mail spool directory (CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL) /etc/login.defs default directives: MAIL_DIR">
