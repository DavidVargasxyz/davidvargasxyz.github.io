<p>Access switches connect directly to end users,</p>
<p>Distribution switches provide a path through which the access switches can forward traffic to each other</p>
<p>each of the access switches connects to at least one distribution switch, typically to two distribution switches for redundancy.</p>
<p>most designs use at least two uplinks to two different distribution switches (as shown in Figure 13-1) for redundancy.</p>

<p>Topology Terminology Seen Within a Two-Tier Design</p>
<p>Star: A design in which one central device connects to several others, so that if you drew the links out in all directions, the design would look like a star with light shining in all directions.</p>
<p>Full mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between each pair of nodes.</p>
<p>Partial mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between some pairs of nodes, but not all. In other words, a mesh that is not a full mesh.</p>
<p>Hybrid: A design that combines topology design concepts into a larger (typically more complex) design.</p>
<p>two-tier design is indeed a hybrid design that uses both a star topology at the access layer and a partial mesh at the distribution layer.</p>
<p>The distribution layer creates a partial mesh.</p>
<p>none of the access layer switches connect to each other.</p>

<p>Access: Provides a connection point (access) for end-user devices. Does not forward frames between two other access switches under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Distribution: Provides an aggregation point for access switches, providing connectivity to the rest of the devices in the LAN, forwarding frames between switches, but not connecting directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>Core: Aggregates distribution switches in very large campus LANs, providing very high forwarding rates for the larger volume of traffic due to the size of the network.</p>

<p>PoE Operation</p>
<p>PoE must (and does) have processes in place to determine if PoE is needed, and for how much power, before applying any potentially harmful power levels to the circuit.</p>
<p>autonegotiation mechanisms need to work before the PD has booted,</p>
<p>By using these IEEE autonegotiation messages and watching for the return signal levels, PoE can determine whether the device on the end of the cable requires power (that is, it is a PD) and how much power to supply</p>
<p>Step 1. Do not supply power on a PoE-capable port unless negotiation identifies that the device needs power.</p>
<p>Step 2. Use Ethernet autonegotiation techniques, sending low power signals and monitoring the return signal, to determine the PoE power class, which determines how much power to supply to the device.</p>
<p>Step 3. If the device is identified as a PD, supply the power per the power class, which allows the device to boot.</p>
<p>Step 4. Monitor for changes to the power class, both with autonegotiation and listening for CDP and LLDP messages from the PD.</p>
<p>Step 5. If a new power class is identified, adjust the power level per that class.</p>
<p>PDs signaling how many watts of power they would like to receive from the PSE. Depending on the specific PoE standard, the PSE will then supply the power, either over two pairs or four pairs, as noted in Table 13-2.</p>

<p>PoE and LAN Design</p>
<p>some of the key points to consider when planning a LAN design that includes PoE:</p>
<p>Powered Devices: Determine the types of devices and specific models, along with their power requirements.</p>
<p>Power Requirements: Plan the numbers of different types of PDs to connect into each wiring closet to build a power budget. That power budget can then be processed to determine the amount of PoE power to make available through each switch.</p>
<p>Switch Ports: Some switches support PoE standards on all ports, some on no ports, some on a subset of ports. Research the various switch models so that you purchase enough PoE-capable ports for the switches planned for each wiring closet.</p>
<p>Switch Power Supplies: Without PoE, when purchasing a switch, you choose a power supply so that it delivers enough power to power the switch itself. With PoE, the switch acts as a distributor of electrical power, so the switch power supply must deliver many more watts than it needs to run the switch itself. You will need to create a power budget per switch, based on the number of connected PDs, and purchase power supplies to match those requirements.</p>
<p>PoE Standards versus Actual: Consider the number of PoE switch ports needed, the standards they support, the standards supported by the PDs, and how much power they consume. For instance, a PD and a switch port may both support PoE+, which supports up to 30 watts supplied by the PSE. However, that powered device may need at most 9 watts to operate, so your power budget needs to reserve less power than the maximum for those devices.</p>
