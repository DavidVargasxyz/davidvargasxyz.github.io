Configuring Dynamic EtherChannels<br>
Cisco switches also support two different configuration options that then use a dynamic protocol to negotiate whether a particular link becomes part of an EtherChannel or not. Basically, the configuration<br>
enables a protocol for a particular channelto send messages to/from the neighboring switch and discover whether their configuration settings pass -group number. At that point, the switch can use the protocol<br>
all checks. If a given physical link passes, the link is added to the EtherChannel and used; if not, it is placed in a down state, and not used, until the configuration inconsistency can be resolved.<br>
Most Cisco Catalyst switches support thestandard Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),Cisco-proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and the IEEE<br>
negotiate so that only links that pass the configuration checks are actually used in an EtherChannel.<br>
LACP does support more links in a channelcan be active at one time, with the others waiting to be used should any of the other links fail.— 16 —as compared to PAgP’s maximum of 8. With LACP, only 8<br>

desirable and auto keywords enable PAgP<br>
active and passive keywords enable LACP.<br>
with PAgP, at least one of the two sides must use desirable, and with LACP, at least one of the two sides must use active.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Do not use the on parameter on one end, and either auto or desirable (or for LACP, active or passive) on the neighboring switch. The on option uses neither PAgP nor LACP, so a configuration that uses on, with
PAgP or LACP options on the other end, would prevent the EtherChannel from working.

</code></pre><p>Physical Interface Configuration and EtherChannels<br>
the switch compares the new physical port’s configuration to the existing ports in the channel. That new physical interface’s settings must be the same as the existing ports’ settings; otherwise, the switch does<br>
not add the new link to the list of approved and working interfaces in the channel. That is, the physical interface remains configured as part of the PortChannel, but it is not used as part of the channel,<br>
The list of items the switch checks includes the following:<br>
▪▪SpeedDuplex<br>
▪▪Operational access or trunking state (all must be access, or all must be trunks)If an access port, the access VLAN<br>
▪▪If a trunk port, the allowed VLAN list (per the switchport trunk allowed command)If a trunk port, the native VLAN<br>
▪STP interface settings<br>
switches check the settings on the neighboring switch. To do so, the switches either use PAgP or LACP (if already in use) or use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) if using manual configuration. When checking<br>
neighbors, all settings except the STP settings must match.</p>

Configuration options for EtherChannel Load Distribution<br>
EtherChannel load distribution makes the choice for each frame based on various numeric values found in the Layer 2, 3, and 4 headers. The process uses one configurable setting as input: the load distribution<br>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>All three tests list the same outgoing physical interface because (1) the method uses only the source MAC address, and
all three tests use the same MAC addresses. All three tests use a different destination MAC address, with different low-order bits, but that had no impact on the choice because the method—src-mac—
does not consider the destination MAC address.
