WAN Traffic Paths to Reach Cloud Services  
Accessing Public Cloud Services Using the Internet
</code></pre><p>Pros and Cons with Connecting to Public Cloud with Internet
good reasons to use the Internet as the WAN connection to a public cloud service:
Agility to order a private WAN connection to the cloud provider because cloud : An enterprise can get started using public cloud without having to wait
providers support Internet connectivity.
Migration another more easily because cloud providers all connect to the Internet.: An enterprise can switch its workload from one cloud provider to
Distributed user Internet with their devices (as in the sales SaaS app example).s: The enterprise’s users are distributed and connect to the
negatives for using the Internet for public cloud access
Security “man in the middle” can attempt to read the contents of data that passes : The Internet is less secure than private WAN connections in that a
to/from the public cloud.
Capacity traffic, so the question of whether the enterprise’s Internet links can handle the : Moving an internal application to the public cloud increases network
additional load needs to be considered.
Quality of Service (QoS): WANs can. Using the Internet may result in a worse user experience than The Internet does not provide QoS, whereas private

**No WAN SLA:** WAN performance and availability to all destinations of a network. WAN service ISPs typically will not provide a service-level agreement (SLA) for

Installing the new private WAN connections takes time, delaying when a company gets started in cloud computing

migrating to a new cloud provider can require another round of private WAN installation, again delaying work projects</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
Intercloud Exchanges  
a cloud consumer can move his workload from one cloud provider to another  
using a private WAN for the cloud is that it adds another barrier to migrating to a new public cloud provider. One solution adds easier migration to the use of a private WAN through a  
cloud service called an intercloud exchange (or simply an intercloud)  
a company that creates a private network as a service
</code></pre><p>you get the same benefits as when connecting with a private WAN connection to a public cloud, but with the additional pro of easier migration to a new cloud provider. The main con
is that using an intercloud exchange introduces another company into the mix.</p>
