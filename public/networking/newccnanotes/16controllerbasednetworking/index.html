the ASIC can feed the fields to be matched, like a MAC address value, into the TCAM, and the TCAM returns the matching table entry, without a need to run a search algorithm.<br>

Programs can pull information from the controller, using the controller’s APIs. The NBIs also enable programs to use the controller’s capabilities to program flows into the devices using the<br>
controller’s SBIs.<br>
An application can run on the same server as the controller and use an NBI, which is an API, so<br>
that two programs can communicate.</p>

<p>Comparing Traditional Versus Controller-Based Networks<br>
Configuration management refers to any feature that changes device configuration, with automated configuration management doing so with software (program) control.<br>
Operational network management includes monitoring, gathering operational data, reporting, and<br>
alerting humans to possible issues</p>
<p>How Automation Impacts Network Management<br>
Centralized controllers formalize and define data models for the configuration and operational data about networks.</p>
<p>Northbound APIs and their underlying data models make it much easier to automate functions versus traditional networks.<br>
The robust data created by controllers makes it possible to automate functions that were not<br>
easily automated without controllers.<br>
The new reimagined software defined networks that use new operational models simplify operations, with automation resulting in more consistent configuration and less errors.<br>
Centralized collection of operational data at controllers allows the application of modern data analytics to networking operational data, providing actionable insights that were likely not<br>
noticeable with the former model.<br>
Time required to complete projects is reduced.<br>
New operational models use external inputs, like considering time-of-day, day-of-week, and<br>
network load.<br>
