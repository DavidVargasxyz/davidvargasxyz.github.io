<p>REST-Based APIs<br>
Applications use application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate.<br>
one program can learn the variables and data structures used by another program, making logic choices based on those values, changing the values of those variables, creating new variables, and deleting variables<br>
some applications create an API, with many other applications using (consuming) the API.<br>
REST-Based (RESTful) APIs<br>
REST APIs include the six attributes<br>
▪ Client/server architecture<br>
▪ Stateless operation<br>
▪ Clear statement of cacheable/uncacheable<br>
▪ Uniform interface<br>
▪ Layered<br>
▪ Code-on-demand<br>
Client/Server Architecture<br>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>the use of HTTP is not a requirement for an API to be considered RESTful.
Stateless Operation
each API request and reply does not use any other past history considered when processing the request.
For comparison, the TCP protocol uses a stateful approach, whereas UDP uses stateless operation
Cacheable (or Not)
improve performance by retrieving resources less often (cacheable)
cacheable resources are marked with a timeframe so that the client knows when to ask for a new copy of the resource again.
</code></pre><p>List and Dictionary Variables<br>
a data structure defines a related set of variables and values<br>
Python uses list variables so that one variable name is assigned a value that is a list of values rather than a single value</p>

REST APIs and HTTP<br>
APIs exist to allow two programs to exchange data<br>
Many APIs need to be available to programs that run on other computers, so the API must define the type of networking protocosupported by the API—and many REST-based APIs use the HTTP protocol. ls<br>
HTTP uses the same principles as REST: it operates with a client/server model; it uses a stateless operational model; and it headers that clearly mark objects as cacheable or not cacheable. It also includes verbs—words that dictate the desired action for a includes<br>
pair HTTP Request and Reply—which matches how applications like to work.<br>
Software CRUD Actions and HTTP Verbs<br>
acronym—CRUD—for the four primary actions performed by an application. Those actions are:<br>
Create:as kept at the serverAllows the client tocreate some new instances of variables and data structures at the server and initialize their values<br>
Read:structures, and values at the clientAllows the client to retrieve (read) the current value of variables that exist at the server, storing a copy of the variables,<br>
Update:Allows the client to change (update) the value of variables that exist at the server<br>
Delete:Allows the client todelete from the server different instances of data variables</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>HTTP uses verbs that mirror CRUD actions.HTTP defines the concept of an HTTP request and reply
Each request/reply lists an action verb in the HTTP request header, which defines the HTTP action. The HTTP messages also incURI, which identifies the resource being manipulated for this request. lude a

REST uses URIs to identify what resource the HTTP request acts on. For REST APIs, the resource can be any one of the many resdefined by the API. Each resource contains a set of related variables, defined by the API and identified by a URI. ources</p>

Path (Resource): This value sits after the first / and finishes either at the end of the URI or before any additional fields (like a parameter query field). HTTP calls this field the path, but for use with REST, the field uniquely identifies the
