<p>all switches claim to be the root by sending Hello BPDUs listing their own BID as the root BID.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>each nonroot switch chooses its one and only root port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The STP/RSTP port cost is simply an integer value assigned to each interface, per VLAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switches also look at their neighbor’s root cost, as announced in Hello BPDUs received from each neighbor.</p>

<p>SW3 calculates its cost to reach the root over the two possible paths by adding the advertised cost (in Hello messages) to the interface costs listed in the figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The root switch sends Hellos, with a listed root cost of 0. The idea is that the root’s cost to reach itself is 0.</p>

</ul>
<p>Choosing the Designated Port on each LAN Segment</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>final step to choose the STP/RSTP topology is to choose the designated port on each LAN segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designated port (DP) on each LAN segment is the switch port that advertises the lowestHello onto a LAN segment. -cost<br>
When a nonroot switch forwards a Hello, the nonroot switch sets the root cost field in the Hello<br>
to that switch’s cost to reach the root. In effect, the switch with the lower cost to reach the root, among all switches connected to a segment, becomes the DP on that segment.</p>

</code></pre><p>Changing Interface States with STP<br>
Roles, like root port and designated port, relate to how STP analyzes the LAN topology.<br>
States, like forwarding and blocking, tell a switch whether to send or receive frames.<br>
When STP converges, a switch chooses new port roles, and the port roles determine the state (forwarding or blocking).<br>
Switches using STP can simply move immediately from forwarding to blocking state, but they must take extra time to transition from blocking state to forwarding state.<br>
when a port that formerly blocked needs to transition to forwarding, the switch first puts<br>
the port through two intermediate interface states.</p>

<p>interface does not forward frames. switch removes old stale (unused) MAC table entries for which no frames are<br>

a convergence event that causes an interface to change from blocking to forwarding<br>
requires 30 seconds to transition from blocking to forwarding.<br>

<li>the role from root port to a disabled port, and the state from forwarding to discarding

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>without waiting on any timers, the switch changes roles and state for the alternate

</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>the switch changes the former root port’s role and state:
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>the new root port also does not need to spend time in other states, such as learning state,
instead moving immediately to forwarding state.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Step 1. The link between SW1 and SW3 fails, so SW3’s current root port (Gi0/1) fails.<br>
Step 2. SW3 and SW2 exchange RSTP messages to confirm that SW3 will now transition its former alternate port (Gi0/2) to be the root port. This action causes SW2 to flush the<br>
required MAC table entries.Step 3. SW3 transitions Gi0/1 to the disabled role and Gi0/2 to the root port role.<br>
Step 4. SW3 transitions Gi0/2 to a forwarding state immediately, without using learning state, because this is one case in which RSTP knows the transition will not create a loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>RSTP States and Processes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>RSTP keeps both the learning and forwarding states as compared with STP, for the same purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP does not even define a listening state,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP renames the blocking state to the discarding state and redefines its use slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP uses the discarding state for what STP defines as two states: disabled state and blocking state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP switches tell each other (using messages) that the topology has changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those messages also direct neighboring switches to flush the contents of their MAC tables in a way that removes all the potentially loop-causing entries, without a wait.<br>
As a result, RSTP creates more scenarios in which a formerly discarding port can immediately transition to a forwarding state, without waiting, and without using the<br>
learning state, as shown in the example in Figure 9-9.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>RSTP backup port role creates a way for RSTP to quickly replace a switch’s designated port
on some LAN.
</code></pre><p>RSTP Port Types<br>
several links between two switches. RSTP considers these links to be point-to-point links<br>
and the ports connected to them to be point-to-point ports</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ports that instead connect to a single endpoint device at the edge of the network, like a PC or server, are called point-to-point edge ports, or simply edge ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;shared&rdquo; to describe ports connected to a hub.<br>
hubs also force the attached switch port to use halfall half-duplex ports may be connected to hubs, treating ports that use half duplex -duplex logic. RSTP assumes that<br>
as shared ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP converges more slowly on shared ports as compared to all point-to-point ports.<br>
Optional STP Features<br>
Etherchannel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switches treat the EtherChannel as a single interface with regard to STP.<br>
Layer 2 EtherChannels combine links that switches use as switch ports, with the<br>
switches using Layer 2 switching logic to forward and receive Ethernet frames over the EtherChannels. Layer 3 EtherChannels also combine links, but the switches use<br>
Layer 3 routing logic to forward packets over the EtherChannels.<br>
PortFast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allows a switch to immediately transition from blocking to forwarding, bypassing listening and learning states.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PortFast
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>only ports on which you can safely enable PortFast are ports on which you
know that no bridges, switches, or other STP-speaking devices are connected.
</code></pre><p>Cisco switches enable RSTP point-to-point edge ports by enabling PortFast on the<br>
port.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>BPDU Guard
</code></pre><ul>
<li>An attacker could connect a switch to one of these ports, one with a low STP/RSTP</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>An attacker could connect a switch to one of these ports, one with a low STP/RSTP priority value, and become the root switch. The new STP/RSTP topology could have
worse performance than the desired topology.
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Tactually forward much of the traffic in the LAN. Without the networking staff he attacker could plug into multiple ports, into multiple switches, become root, and
realizing it, the attacker could use a LAN analyzer to copy large numbers of data
frames sent through the LAN.
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Users could innocently harm the LAN when they buy and connect an inexpensive consumer LAN switch (one that does not use STP/RSTP). Such a switch, without any
STP/RSTP function, would not choose to block any ports and could cause a loop.
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Cisco BPDU Guard feature helps defeat these kinds of problems by disabling a port if
any BPDUs are received on the port.that should be used only as an access port and never connected to another switch.So, this feature is particularly useful on ports
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>In addition, the BPDU Guard feature helps prevent problems with PortFast. PortFast
should be enabled only on access ports that connect to user devices, not to other LAN switches. Using BPDU Guard on these same ports makes sense because if
another switch connects to such a port, the local switch can disable the port before
a loop is created.
